* Tasks

** TODO Formulate some /formal/ hypotheses
*** In general for project

*** Specifically the RNA-seq data

- /There are no differences in water treatments at 05hr for../
  - /Col0 and Cerk1/
  - /Col0 and Lym2/
  - /Cerk1 and Lym2/

- /There are no differences in chitin treatments at 05hr for../
  - /Col0 and Cerk1/
  - /Col0 and Lym2/
  - /Cerk1 and Lym2/

- /There are no differences in water treatments at 6hr for../
  - /Col0 and Cerk1/
  - /Col0 and Lym2/
  - /Cerk1 and Lym2/

- /There are no differences in chitin treatments at 6hr for../
  - /Col0 and Cerk1/
  - /Col0 and Lym2/
  - /Cerk1 and Lym2/


**** Venn Diagram to aid understanding

When reading the following Venn diagram read it as such: Overlapping sections are where under chitin treatment there are differences.

** TODO Brush up on plant anatomy
- Specifically, looking at sections mentioned in citet:yanSphingolipidBiosynthesisModulates2019

** DONE Compare citet:stringlisRootTranscriptionalDynamics2018 multiqc to ours
   CLOSED: [2019-06-17 Mon 10:39]

** TODO There are different structures of PD, investigate
- Are they tissue specific, or do we need to consider them in leaf tissue?
