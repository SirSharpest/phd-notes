  abstract = {Phenotyping is a critical component of plant research. Accurate and precise trait collection, when integrated with genetic tools, can greatly accelerate the rate of genetic gain in crop improvement. However, efficient and automatic phenotyping of traits across large populations is a challenge; which is further exacerbated by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials. A promising approach is to leverage current advances in imaging technology, data analytics and machine learning to enable automated and fast phenotyping and subsequent decision support. In this context, the workflow for phenotyping (image capture~$\rightarrow$~data storage and curation~$\rightarrow$~trait extraction~$\rightarrow$~machine learning/classification~$\rightarrow$~models/apps for decision support) has to be carefully designed and efficiently executed to minimize resource usage and maximize utility. We illustrate such an end-to-end phenotyping workflow for the case of plant stress severity phenotyping in soybean, with a specific focus on the rapid and automatic assessment of iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) severity on thousands of field plots. We showcase this analytics framework by extracting IDC features from a set of \~4500 unique canopies representing a diverse germplasm base that have different levels of IDC, and subsequently training a variety of classification models to predict plant stress severity. The best classifier is then deployed as a smartphone app for rapid and real time severity rating in the field. We investigated 10 different classification approaches, with the best classifier being a hierarchical classifier with a mean per-class accuracy of \~96\%. We construct a phenotypically meaningful `population canopy graph', connecting the automatically extracted canopy trait features with plant stress severity rating. We incorporated this image capture~$\rightarrow$~image processing~$\rightarrow$~classification workflow into a smartphone app that enables automated real-time evaluation of IDC scores using digital images of the canopy. We expect this high-throughput framework to help increase the rate of genetic gain by providing a robust extendable framework for other abiotic and biotic stresses. We further envision this workflow embedded onto a high throughput phenotyping ground vehicle and unmanned aerial system that will allow real-time, automated stress trait detection and quantification for plant research, breeding and stress scouting applications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Self-pollination dominates in wheat, with a small level of out-crossing due to flowering asynchrony and male sterility. However, the timing and synchrony of male and female flowering in wheat is a crucial determinant of seed set and may be an important factor affecting gene flow and resilience to climate change. Here, a methodology is presented for assessing the timing and synchrony of flowering in wheat, Triticum aestivum. METHODS From the onset of flowering until the end of anthesis, the anther and stigma activity of each floret was assessed on the first five developing ears in potted plants grown under ambient conditions and originating from 'Paragon' or 'Spark-Rialto' backgrounds. At harvest maturity, seed presence, size and weight was recorded for each floret scored. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The synchrony between pollen dehiscence and stigma collapse within a flower was dependent on its relative position in a spike and within a floret. Determined on the basis of synchrony within each flower, the level of pollination by pollen originating from other flowers reached approx. 30 \% and did not change throughout the duration of flowering. A modelling exercise parameterized by flowering observations indicated that the temporal and spatial variability of anther activity within and between spikes may influence the relative resilience of wheat to sudden, extreme climatic events which has direct relevance to predicted future climate scenarios in the UK.},

  doi = {10.3389/fpls.2015.00724},
  abstract = {The quantification of floral shape variations is difficult because flower structures are both diverse and complex. Traditionally, floral shape variations are quantified using the qualitative and linear measurements of two-dimensional (2D) images. The 2D images cannot adequately describe flower structures, and thus lead to unsatisfactory discrimination of the flower shape. This study aimed to acquire three-dimensional (3D) images by using microcomputed tomography ($\mu$CT) and to examine the floral shape variations by using geometric morphometrics (GM). To demonstrate the advantages of the 3D-$\mu$CT-GM approach, we applied the approach to a second-generation population of florist's gloxinia (Sinningia speciosa) crossed from parents of zygomorphic and actinomorphic flowers. The flowers in the population considerably vary in size and shape, thereby served as good materials to test the applicability of the proposed phenotyping approach. Procedures were developed to acquire 3D volumetric flower images using a $\mu$CT scanner, to segment the flower regions from the background, and to select homologous characteristic points (i.e., landmarks) from the flower images for the subsequent GM analysis. The procedures identified 95 landmarks for each flower and thus improved the capability of describing and illustrating the flower shapes, compared with typically lower number of landmarks in 2D analyses. The GM analysis demonstrated that flower opening and dorsoventral symmetry were the principal shape variations of the flowers. The degrees of flower opening and corolla asymmetry were then subsequently quantified directly from the 3D flower images. The 3D-$\mu$CT-GM approach revealed shape variations that could not be identified using typical 2D approaches and accurately quantified the flower traits that presented a challenge in 2D images. The approach opens new avenues to investigate floral shape variations.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a central process in plant immunity. The induction or repression of defense genes is orchestrated by signaling networks that are directed by plant hormones of which salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are the major players. Extensive cross-communication between the hormone signaling pathways allows for fine tuning of transcriptional programs, determining resistance to invaders and trade-offs with plant development. Here, we give an overview of how SA can control transcriptional reprogramming of JA-induced genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. SA can influence activity and/or localization of transcriptional regulators by post-translational modifications of transcription factors and co-regulators. SA-induced redox changes, mediated by thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, modify transcriptional regulators that are involved in suppression of JA-dependent genes, such as NPR1 and TGA transcription factors, which affects their localization or DNA binding activity. Furthermore, SA can mediate sequestering of JA-responsive transcription factors away from their target genes by stalling them in the cytosol or in complexes with repressor proteins in the nucleus. SA also affects JA-induced transcription by inducing degradation of transcription factors with an activating role in JA signaling, as was shown for the ERF transcription factor ORA59. Additionally, SA can induce negative regulators, among which WRKY transcription factors, that can directly or indirectly inhibit JA-responsive gene expression. Finally, at the DNA level, modification of histones by SA-dependent factors can result in repression of JA-responsive genes. These diverse and complex regulatory mechanisms affect important signaling hubs in the integration of hormone signaling networks. Some pathogens have evolved effectors that highjack hormone crosstalk mechanisms for their own good, which are described in this review as well.},

No targeted therapies are currently approved for TNBC, and newer treatment approaches are critically needed. It is increasingly recognized that TNBC is a heterogeneous disease, and the role of androgen signaling in a subset of TNBC is emerging. Although the degree of androgen receptor (AR) expression in TNBC varies widely depending on the assay methodology, cutoff for positivity, and patient population, existing evidence suggests an association between a higher level of AR expression and improved outcomes. Despite lower pathologic complete response (pCR) rates with neoadjuvant therapy, patients with AR-dependent TNBCs have a better prognosis than those with TNBCs that are not AR-dependent. Furthermore, gene expression profiling has been used to identify a luminal androgen receptor subtype of TNBC that is dependent on AR signaling. Early clinical studies investigating agents targeting AR in advanced TNBC have produced promising results. We review herein the literature on the biology of AR in breast cancer and its prognostic and predictive role in TNBC, and we describe the results of early clinical trials with antiandrogens in this population. We also present our vision of the future development of newer therapeutic strategies in AR-dependent.},

Although there is a wide range of traditional, optical-based techniques for visualization and quantification of plant morphology and anatomy, ranging from imaging of thin sections to confocal microscopy of intact specimens, their use is usually limited by the type and size of sample material. Furthermore, analysis is often time consuming, destructive, and constrained to two dimensions (2D) (classical histology) or limited in optical depth (confocal microscopy).\textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {In plants, mounting an effective innate immune strategy against microbial pathogens involves triggering local cell death within infected cells as well as boosting the immunity of the uninfected neighboring and systemically located cells. Although not much is known about this, it is evident that well-coordinated cell-cell signaling is critical in this process to confine infection to local tissue while allowing for the spread of systemic immune signals throughout the whole plant. In support of this notion, direct cell-to-cell communication was recently found to play a crucial role in plant defense. Here, we provide experimental evidence that salicylic acid (SA) is a critical hormonal signal that regulates cell-to-cell permeability during innate immune responses elicited by virulent bacterial infection in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that direct exogenous application of SA or bacterial infection suppresses cell-cell coupling and that SA pathway mutants are impaired in this response. The SA- or infection-induced suppression of cell-cell coupling requires an enhanced desease resistance1- and nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes1-dependent SA pathway in conjunction with the regulator of plasmodesmal gating Plasmodesmata-located protein5. We discuss a model wherein the SA signaling pathway and plasmodesmata-mediated cell-to-cell communication converge under an intricate regulatory loop.},

  abstract = {Grain shape and size are involved in the main components of the domestication syndrome in cereals. Wheat grain shape has been dramatically altered at each stage of the domestication of tetraploid wheat and through common wheat speciation. To elucidate the evolutionary change of wheat grain shape, principal component (PC) analysis of grain shape-related traits was first conducted using wild and cultivated tetraploid, synthetic hexaploid, and common wheat accessions. The synthetic hexaploid wheat lines were previously produced through interspecific crosses between two common wheat progenitors, tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii, and produced grains similar to those of cultivated tetraploid wheat. To identify genetic loci related to the difference in grain shape between common wheat and the synthetic wheat, the 15 traits related to grain and spikelet shape were measured in 108 F(2) individuals between Norin 61 and a synthetic wheat line, and the first three PC values for the 15 traits, PC1, PC2 and PC3, were mapped as quantitative traits in the F(2) population. In total, six QTLs, found on chromosomes 1A, 5A, 1D, 2D and 7D, showed significant LOD scores. Among them, a QTL for PC2, located on the 2DS chromosomal region near the Ppd-D1 locus, mainly contributed to the phenotypic difference in grain shape. Tg-D1, controlling tenacious glume phenotype, was located at a similar region to the 2DS QTL, which suggested that the Tg-D1 locus pleiotropically affects not only glume toughness but also spikelet and grain shape in hexaploid wheat. Therefore, it was predicted that wheat grains were rapidly improved toward a shorter and rounder phenotype accompanied with free-threshing wheat formation.},

The most recent paradigm to gain wide acceptance in the field is often referred to as the zigzag model, which reconciles the previously formulated gene-for-gene hypothesis with the recognition of general elici- tors in a single model. This review focuses on the limitations of the current paradigm of molecular plant-microbe interactions and how it too narrowly defines the plant immune system. As such, we discuss an alternative view of plant innate immunity as a system that evolves to detect invasion. This view accommodates the range from mutualistic to parasitic symbioses that plants form with diverse organisms, as well as the spectrum of ligands that the plant immune system perceives. Finally, how this view can contribute to the current practice of resistance breeding is discussed.},

Molecular genetics and archaeological data have allowed the reconstruction of plausible domestication scenarios leading to modern cultivars. For diploid einkorn and tetraploid durum wheat, a single domestication event has likely occurred in the Karacadag Mountains, Turkey. Following a cross between tetraploid durum and diploid T. tauschii, the resultant hexaploid bread wheat was domesticated and disseminated around the Caucasian region. These polyploidisation events facilitated wheat domestication and created genetic bottlenecks, which excluded potentially adaptive alleles. With the urgent need to accelerate genetic progress to confront the challenges of climate change and sustainable agriculture, wild ancestors and old landraces represent a reservoir of underexploited genetic diversity that may be utilized through modern breeding methods. Understanding domestication processes may thus help identifying new strategies. \textcopyright{} 2011 Acad\'emie des sciences.},

Here we show that the Multiple C2 domains and Transmembrane region Protein (MCTP) family, key regulators of cell-to-cell signalling in plants, act as ER - PM tethers specifically at plasmodesmata. We report that MCTPs are core plasmodesmata proteins that insert into the ER via their transmembrane region whilst their C2 domains dock to the PM through interaction with anionic phospholipids. A mctp3/4 loss-of-function mutant induces plant developmental defects while MCTP4 expression in a yeast $\Delta$tether mutant partially restores ER-PM tethering.

Based on a commonly used hydroponic culture system, we found that variations in growth conditions have a major impact on the plant's overall capacity to deposit callose. This environmental variability correlated with levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Depending on the growth conditions, pretreatment with abscissic acid stimulated or repressed callose deposition.

This paper reports QTL analyses of kernel morphology in two hexaploid wheat mapping populations, grown in NY and CA. Kernel morphology was evaluated through a new and improved method, combining measurements from two orthogonal pictures. Single marker regression showed that several genomic positions, scattered through the genome, were related to kernel size and shape, in both populations. The direction of allele effects was consistent between environments, although the LOD scores varied considerably. Composite interval mapping revealed QTLs on all seven homoeologous groups, considering both populations. For the QTLs detected through this method, the signal and magnitude of additive effects were similar between environments, indicating small QTL \texttimes{} environment interaction. In the population W7984 \texttimes{} Opata 85, the strongest signal was detected on the chromosome 5B, for kernel length. In the population AC Reed \texttimes{} Grandin, the most important QTLs were detected on chromosome 2D, affecting the lateral dimensions of the kernel. This study agreed with previous reports that the genetic control of kernel length and width are largely independent. Additionally, it was shown that QTLs detected on different mapping populations, with identical evaluation methods, can be very distinct. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  volume = {100},
  issn = {03057364},
  doi = {10.1093/aob/mcm048},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Archaeobotany, the study of plant remains from sites of ancient human activity, provides data for studying the initial evolution of domesticated plants. An important background to this is defining the domestication syndrome, those traits by which domesticated plants differ from wild relatives. These traits include features that have been selected under the conditions of cultivation. From archaeological remains the easiest traits to study are seed size and in cereal crops the loss of natural seed dispersal.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSCOPE: The rate at which these features evolved and the ordering in which they evolved can now be documented for a few crops of Asia and Africa. This paper explores this in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) from the Near East, rice (Oryza sativa) from China, mung (Vigna radiata) and urd (Vigna mungo) beans from India, and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) from west Africa. Brief reference is made to similar data on lentils (Lens culinaris), peas (Pisum sativum), soybean (Glycine max) and adzuki bean (Vigna angularis). Available quantitative data from archaeological finds are compiled to explore changes with domestication. The disjunction in cereals between seed size increase and dispersal is explored, and rates at which these features evolved are estimated from archaeobotanical data. Contrasts between crops, especially between cereals and pulses, are examined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in domesticated grasses, changes in grain size and shape evolved prior to non-shattering ears or panicles. Initial grain size increases may have evolved during the first centuries of cultivation, within perhaps 500-1000 years. Non-shattering infructescences were much slower, becoming fixed about 1000-2000 years later. This suggests a need to reconsider the role of sickle harvesting in domestication. Pulses, by contrast, do not show evidence for seed size increase in relation to the earliest cultivation, and seed size increase may be delayed by 2000-4000 years. This implies that conditions that were sufficient to select for larger seed size in Poaceae were not sufficient in Fabaceae. It is proposed that animal-drawn ploughs (or ards) provided the selection pressure for larger seeds in legumes. This implies different thresholds of selective pressure, for example in relation to differing seed ontogenetics and underlying genetic architecture in these families. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) may show some similarities to the pulses in terms of a lag-time before truly larger-grained forms evolved.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1203458110},
  abstract = {Chitin acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern from fungal pathogens whose perception triggers a range of defense responses. We show that LYSIN MOTIF DOMAIN-CONTAINING GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-ANCHORED PROTEIN 2 (LYM2), the Arabidopsis homolog of a rice chitin receptor-like protein, mediates a reduction in molecular flux via plasmodesmata in the presence of chitin. For this response, lym2-1 mutants are insensitive to the presence of chitin, but not to the flagellin derivative flg22. Surprisingly, the chitin-recognition receptor CHITIN ELCITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) is not required for chitin-induced changes to plasmodesmata flux, suggesting that there are at least two chitin-activated response pathways in Arabidopsis and that LYM2 is not required for CERK1-mediated chitin-triggered defense responses, indicating that these pathways are independent. In accordance with a role in the regulation of intercellular flux, LYM2 is resident at the plasma membrane and is enriched at plasmodesmata. Chitin-triggered regulation of molecular flux between cells is required for defense responses against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, and thus we conclude that the regulation of symplastic continuity and molecular flux between cells is a vital component of chitin-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis.},

The intent of this review is to bring into focus the role of PD in cell-to-cell and long distance communication in plants. We consider how cellular RNAs could move through the cell to the PD and thence through PD. The protein composition of PD and the possible roles of PD proteins in RNA trafficking are also discussed. Recent evidence for RNA metabolism in organelles acting as a factor in controlling PD flux is also presented, highlighting new aspects of plant intra- and intercellular communication. It is clear that while the phenomenon of RNA mobility is common and essential, many questions remain, and these have been highlighted throughout this review.},

  abstract = {Plants respond to biotic stress by inducing a variety of responses, which not only protect against the immediate diseases but also provide immunity from future infections. One example is systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which provides long-lasting and broad-spectrum protection at the whole plant level. The induction of SAR prepares the plant for a more robust response to subsequent infections from related and unrelated pathogens. SAR involves the rapid generation of signals at the primary site of infection, which are transported to the systemic parts of the plant presumably via the phloem. SAR signal generation and perception requires an intact cuticle, a waxy layer covering all aerial parts of the plant. A chemically diverse set of SAR inducers has already been identified, including hormones (salicylic acid, methyl salicylate), primary/secondary metabolites (nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, glycerol-3-phosphate, azelaic acid, pipecolic acid, dihyroabetinal), fatty acid/lipid derivatives (18 carbon unsaturated fatty acids, galactolipids), and proteins (DIR1-Defective in Induced Resistance 1, AZI1-Azelaic acid Induced 1). Some of these are demonstrably mobile and the phloem loading routes for three of these SAR inducers is known. Here we discuss the recent findings related to synthesis, transport, and the relationship between these various SAR inducers.},

  abstract = {Cell-to-cell communication is fundamental to multicellular life. For this to occur effectively there must be pathways and dynamic networks for communication. These might depend upon electrical or chemical signals or the mass transfer of molecules between adjacent cells. Molecular communication occurs either via an extra-cellular pathway or through physical structures, called plasmodesmata, that connect the cytoplasm of neighboring cells. Plasmodesmata bridge the rigid physical barrier presented by the cell wall to extend the symplasm from single cells to tissue domains that have functional importance for tissue growth, development, and defense. Although recent years have seen advances in our knowledge of the physical nature of PD, the trafficked molecules, and of the wider processes they affect, our knowledge of PD structure and function is still relatively rudimentary. This article will consider the technical/experimental difficulties hindering PD research and suggest priorities in the future research effort that might advance the field at a significantly faster rate.},

In angiosperms, a mature seed consists of the embryo, the endosperm and the seed coat, which develop from the zygote, the fertilized central cell and the maternal integuments, respectively. Seed size is therefore coordinately controlled by the growth of maternal and zygotic tissues. Several signaling pathways that determine seed size by influencing the endosperm and/or maternal tissue growth have been identified, including the IKU pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, G-protein signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, phytohormones and transcriptional regulatory factors. The functions of several seed size regulators are conserved in Arabidopsis and rice; therefore it is promising to convert basic research on seed size into practical applications in crops. In this review, we summarize recent research progress on seed size control, with particular emphasis on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of several newly identified regulators of seed size in Arabidopsis and rice.},

  abstract = {We described advection and diffusion of water isotopologues in leaves in the non-steady state, applied specifically to amphistomatous leaves. This explains the isotopic enrichment of leaf water from the xylem to the mesophyll, and we showed how it relates to earlier models of leaf water enrichment in non-steady state. The effective length or tortuosity factor of isotopologue movement in leaves is unknown and, therefore, is a fitted parameter in the model. We compared the advection-diffusion model to previously published data sets for Lupinus angustifolius and Eucalyptus globulus. Night-time stomatal conductance was not measured in either data set and is therefore another fitted parameter. The model compared very well with the observations of bulk mesophyll water during the whole diel cycle. It compared well with the enrichment at the evaporative sites during the day but showed some deviations at night for E. globulus. It became clear from our analysis that night-time stomatal conductance should be measured in the future and that the temperature dependence of the tracer diffusivities should be accounted for. However, varying mesophyll water volume did not seem critical for obtaining a good prediction of leaf water enrichment, at least in our data sets. In addition, observations of single diurnal cycles do not seem to constrain the effective length that relates to the tortuosity of the water path in the mesophyll. Finally, we showed when simpler models of leaf water enrichment were suitable for applications of leaf water isotopes once weighted with the appropriate gas exchange flux. We showed that taking an unsuitable leaf water enrichment model could lead to large biases when cumulated over only 1 day.},

  abstract = {In plants, plasmodesmata (PD) serve as channels for micromolecular and macromolecular cell-to-cell transport. Based on structure, PD in immature tissues are classified into two types, simple and branched (X- and Y-shaped) or twinned. The maximum size of molecules capable of PD transport defines PD aperture, known as the PD size exclusion limit. Here we report an Arabidopsis mutation, decreased size exclusion limit1 (dse1), that exhibits reduced cell-to-cell transport of the small (524 Da) fluorescent tracer 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid at the midtorpedo stage of embryogenesis. Correspondingly, the fraction of X- and Y-shaped and twinned PD was reduced in dse1 embryos compared with WT embryos at this stage, suggesting that the frequency of PD is related to transport capability. dse1 is caused by a point mutation in At4g29860 (previously termed TANMEI) at the last donor splice site of its transcript, resulting in alternative splicing in both the first intron and the last intron. AtDSE1 is a conserved eukaryotic 386-aa WD-repeat protein critical for Arabidopsis morphogenesis and reproduction. Similar to its homologs in mouse, null mutants are embryo-lethal. The weak loss-of-function mutant dse1 exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes, including retarded vegetative growth, delayed flowering time, dysfunctional male and female organs, and delayed senescence. Finally, silencing of DSE1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves leads to reduced movement of GFP fused to tobacco mosaic virus movement protein. Thus, DSE1 is important for regulating PD transport between plant cells.},

A double Gaussian fitted simultaneously to grain number and weight data from two contrasting elite lines (Renesansa, listed in Serbia, Ppd-D1a, Rht8; Savannah, listed in UK, Ppd-D1b, Rht-D1b) identified peak periods of main stem susceptibility centred on 3 (s.e.= 0.82) and 18 (s.e. = 0.55) days (mean daily temperature = 14.3oC) pre-GS 65 for both cultivars. Severity of effect depended on genotype, growth stage and their interaction: grain set relative to that achieved at 20/15oC dropped below 80\% for Savannah at booting and Renesansa at anthesis. Savannah was relatively tolerant to heat stress at anthesis. A further experiment including 62 lines of the mapping, doubled-haploid progeny of Renesansa x Savannah found tolerance at anthesis to be associated with Ppd-D1b, Rht-D1b, and a QTL from Renesansa on chromosome 2A. None of the relevant markers were associated with tolerance during booting. Rht8 was never associated with heat stress tolerance, a lack of effect confirmed in a further experiment where Rht8 was included in a comparison of near isogenic lines in a cv. Paragon background. Some compensatory increases in mean grain weight were observed, but only when stress was applied during booting and only where Ppd-D1a was absent.},

  abstract = {pThe biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis causes smut disease in maize with characteristic tumor formation and anthocyanin induction. Here, we show that anthocyanin biosynthesis is induced by the virulence promoting secreted effector protein Tin2. Tin2 protein functions inside plant cells where it interacts with maize protein kinase ZmTTK1. Tin2 masks a ubiquitin\textendash{}proteasome degradation motif in ZmTTK1, thus stabilizing the active kinase. Active ZmTTK1 controls activation of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Without Tin2, enhanced lignin biosynthesis is observed in infected tissue and vascular bundles show strong lignification. This is presumably limiting access of fungal hyphae to nutrients needed for massive proliferation. Consistent with this assertion, we observe that maize brown midrib mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis are hypersensitive to U. maydis infection. We speculate that Tin2 rewires metabolites into the anthocyanin pathway to lower their availability for other defense responses./p},

However, little is known about the role of PD-mediated signaling during plant morphogenesis. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis gene, CALS3/GSL12. Gain-of-function mutations in CALS3 result in increased accumulation of callose ($\beta$-1,3-glucan) at the PD, a decrease in PD aperture, defects in root development, and reduced intercellular trafficking. Enhancement of CALS3 expression during phloem development suppressed loss-of-function mutations in the phloem abundant callose synthase, CALS7 indicating that CALS3 is a bona fide callose synthase. CALS3 alleles allowed us to spatially and temporally control the PD aperture between plant tissues. Using this tool, we are able to show that movement of the transcription factor SHORT-ROOT and microRNA165 between the stele and the endodermis is PD dependent. Taken together, we conclude that regulated callose biosynthesis at PD is essential for cell signaling. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Genetic analysis of the yield and physical quality of wheat revealed complex genetic control, including strong effects of photoperiod-sensitivity loci. Environmental conditions such as moisture deficit and high temperatures during the growing period affect the grain yield and grain characteristics of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The aim of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain yield and grain quality traits using a Drysdale/Gladius bread wheat mapping population grown under a range of environmental conditions in Australia and Mexico. In general, yield and grain quality were reduced in environments exposed to drought and/or heat stress. Despite large effects of known photoperiod-sensitivity loci (Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1) on crop development, grain yield and grain quality traits, it was possible to detect QTL elsewhere in the genome. Some of these QTL were detected consistently across environments. A locus on chromosome 6A (TaGW2) that is known to be associated with grain development was associated with grain width, thickness and roundness. The grain hardness (Ha) locus on chromosome 5D was associated with particle size index and flour extraction and a region on chromosome 3B was associated with grain width, thickness, thousand grain weight and yield. The genetic control of grain length appeared to be largely independent of the genetic control of the other grain dimensions. As expected, effects on grain yield were detected at loci that also affected yield components. Some QTL displayed QTL-by-environment interactions, with some having effects only in environments subject to water limitation and/or heat stress.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Mice were inoculated intrarectally with saline, ethanol or different TNBS solutions. 1\%TNBS induced clinical signs of colitis (P less than 0.01) and histological damage (P less than 0.01). Based on these results, mice were pre-treated with Citogenex or saline for 1, 2 or 3 weeks before 1\%TNBS treatment. Probiotic pre-treatment determined a reduction of clinical signs (P less than 0.05), histological alterations of colitis (P less than 0.05) and increased beneficial bacteria (P less than 0.05). This study confirms that TNBS-induced colitis in CD-1 mice is useful for studying the mechanisms involved in IBD pathogenesis, and pre-treatment with Citogenex prevents the intestinal damage induced by TNBS.},

Yield safety can only be improved if future breeding attempts will be based on the valuable new knowledge acquired on the processes determining plant development and its responses to stress. Plant stress responses are very complex. Interactions between plant structure, function and the environment need to be investigated at various phases of plant development at the organismal, cellular as well as molecular levels in order to obtain a full picture. The results achieved so far in this field indicate that various plant organs, in a definite hierarchy and in interaction with each other, are involved in determining crop yield under stress.

  abstract = {Research on academic writing has long stressed the connection between writing and the creation of an author's identity (Ivani{\v c}, 1998; Hyland, 2010). Identity is said to be created from the texts we engage in and the linguistic choices we make, thus relocating it from hidden processes of cognition to its social construction in discourse. Issues of agency and conformity, stability and change, remain controversial, however. Some writers question whether there is an unchanging self lurking behind such discourse and suggest that identity is a ``performance'' (see for instance Butler, 1990) while others see identity as the product of dominant discourses tied to institutional practices (Foucault, 1972). All this has been of particular interest to teachers and researchers of EAP because students and academics alike often feel uncomfortably positioned, even alienated, by the conventions of academic discourse. They sometimes complain that the voice they are forced to use requires them to ``talk like a book'' by adopting a formal and coldly analytical persona.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn this paper I want to explore how we construct an identity in three rather neglected academic genres where the requirements of anonymity and impersonality are more relaxed. In thesis acknowledgements, doctoral prize applications and bio statements, writers are exempted from formal conventions of disciplinary argument and have an opportunity to reveal something of how they want to be seen by others. My question is: What use do they make of with these opportunities?},

  abstract = {Root system interaction and competition for resources is an active research area that contributes to our understanding of roots' perception and reaction to environmental conditions. Recent research has shown this complex suite of processes can now be observed in a natural environment (i.e. soil) through the use of X-ray micro Computed Tomography ($\mu$CT), which allows non-destructive analysis of plant root systems. Due to their similar X-ray attenuation coefficients and densities, the roots of different plants appear as similar greyscale intensity values in $\mu$CT image data. Unless they are manually and carefully traced, it has previously not been possible to automatically label and separate different root systems grown in the same soil environment. We present a technique, based on a visual tracking approach, which exploits knowledge of the shape of root cross-sections to automatically recover 3D descriptions of multiple, interacting root architectures growing in soil from X-ray $\mu$CT data. The method was evaluated on both simulated root data and real images of two interacting winter wheat Cordiale (Triticumaestivum L.) plants grown in a single soil column, demonstrating that it is possible to automatically segment different root systems from within the same soil sample. This work supports the automatic exploration of supportive and competitive foraging behaviour of plant root systems in natural soil environments. This article is protected by copyright.

Statistical hy- pothesis testing, in which the null hypothesis about the properties of a population is almost always known a priori to be false, is contrasted with scientific hypothesis testing, which examines a credible null hypothesis about phenomena in nature.

Methods: The cognitive function of 60 PD patients without dementia and 50 controls were detected by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and LOTCA, and the relative factors which bring on cognitive impairment were analyzed. Results: Of the 60 PD patients without dementia, 2 cases(3.3\%) were found cognitive impairment by MMSE, while 23 cases(38. 3\%) were found cognitive impairment by LOTCA, and which were mostly found in visuo-motor organization and thinking operation. The univariate analysis found that age, onset age, depression, dyskinetic severity and type were related with cognitive impairment. Multiplicity Logistic regression analysis showed that age, depression and posture-unsteadiness and gaitirregularity (PICD) type of dyskinesia were risk factors of cognitive impairment. Conclusions: LOTCA is suitable to assess the cognitive impairment in PD patients without dementia. Age, depression and PIGD type of dyskinesia may be the risk factors of influence on cognitive function in PD patients without dementia.},

Similarly, some genes were specifically induced very close to the lesion while others in more distal tissue. Clustering of expression profiles resulting from other biotic and abiotic interactions with Arabidopsis indicated a large overlap in gene expression.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether the unique physical milieu just beneath the cell plasma membrane influences the rheology of fluid-phase cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic viscosity was evaluated from the picosecond rotation of the small fluorophore 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) by parallel-acquisition Fourier transform microfluorimetry (Fushimi and Verkman, 1991). Information about viscosity within  200 nm of cell plasma membranes was obtained by selective excitation of fluorophores in an evanescent field created by total internal reflection (TIR) of impulse-modulated s-plane-polarized laser illumination (488 nm) at a glass-aqueous interface. Measurements of fluorescence lifetime and time-resolved anisotropy were carried out in solutions containing fluorescein or BCECF at known viscosities, and monolayers of BCECF-labeled Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Specific concerns associated with time-resolved fluorescence measurements in the evanescent field were examined theoretically and/or experimentally, including variations in lifetime due to fluorophore proximity to the interface, and the use of the s and p polarized excitation. In fluorescein solutions excited with s-plane polarized light, there was a 5\textendash{}10\% decrease in fluorescein lifetime with TIR compared to trans (subcritical) illumination, but no change in rotational correlation time (approximately 98 ps/cP). Intracellular BCECF had a single lifetime of 3.7 +/- 0.1 ns near the cell plasma membrane. Apparent fluid-phase viscosity near the cell plasma membrane was 1.1 +/- 0.2 cP (fibroblast) and 1.0 +/- 0.2 cP (MDCK), not significantly different from the viscosity measured in bulk cytoplasm far from the plasma membrane. The results establish the methodology for time-resolved microfluorimetric measurement of polarization in the evanescent field and demonstrate that the cell plasma membrane has little effect on the fluid-phase viscosity of adjacent cytoplasm. \textcopyright{} 1993, The Biophysical Society.

The aim of this paper is to examine the genotypic variability of leaf chlorophyll, stem water-soluble carbohydrate content and carbon isotope discrimination ( 13? C), and their relationship with grain yield (GY) and other agronomical traits, under contrasting water conditions in a Mediterranean environment. The study was performed on a large collection of 384 wheat genotypes grown under water stress (WS, rainfed), mild water stress (MWS, deficit irrigation), and full irrigation (FI). The average GY of two growing seasons was 2.4, 4.8, and 8.9 Mg ha-1 under WS, MWS, and FI, respectively. Chlorophyll content at anthesis was positively correlated with GY(except under FI in 2011) and the agronomical components kernels per spike (KS) and thousand kernel weight (TKW). The WSC content at anthesis (WSCCa) was negatively correlated with spikes per square meter (SM2), but positively correlated with KS and TKW underWSand FI conditions. As a consequence, the relationships between WSCCa with GY were low or not significant. Therefore, selecting for high stem WSC would not necessary lead to genotypes of GY potential. The relationship between 13? C and GY was positive under FI andMWSbut negative under severeWS(in 2011), indicating higher water use under yield potential and MWS conditions.},

Although altered expression of cell-cycle genes frequently leads to altered organ growth, there are many examples where manipulation of the division machinery leads to a limited outcome at the level of organ form, despite changes in constituent cell size. One possibility, which has been under-explored, is that altered division patterns resulting from manipulation of cell-cycle gene expression alter the physiology of the organ, and that this has an effect on growth. We performed a series of experiments on retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR), a well characterized regulator of the cell cycle, to investigate the outcome of altered cell division on leaf physiology. Our approach involved combination of high-resolution microCT imaging and physiological analysis with a transient gene induction system, providing a powerful approach for the study of developmental physiology. Our investigation identifies a new role for RBR in mesophyll differentiation that affects tissue porosity and the distribution of air space within the leaf. The data demonstrate the importance of RBR in early leaf development and the extent to which physiology adapts to modified cellular architecture resulting from altered cell-cycle gene expression.},

In order to determine the possible structural and func- tional effects of callose, its deposition was inhibited through incuba- tion of the plant tissue with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DDG) for 1 h prior to fixation in 2.5\% glutaraldehyde. The inhibition of callose forma- tion was monitored through aniline blue-induced fluorescence of cal- lose. The neck region of the plasmodesmata from Allium cepa L. roots treated with DDG exhibited a funnel-shaped configuration. This is in contrast to the plasmodesmata from tissue not incubated with DDG, which exhibited constricted necks similar to those previ- ously reported. Both initial dissection and glutaraldehyde fixation induced neck constriction in plasmodesmata, however, dissection of tissue increased the frequency of constrictions. The inhibition of cap lose formation by chemical means showed that the neck constrictions and raised collars in this area are artefacts due to physical wounding and glutaraldehyde fixation. The external electron-dense material observed when tannic acid is included in the primary fixative appears to be unrelated to the deposition of callose at the neck region},

Selective in vitro use of radiolabeled ATP analogs by -as kinases can be exploited to identify the direct phosphorylation targets of individual kinases in complex extracts. In organisms in which it is practical to replace wild-type kinase genes with engineered alleles, the in vivo activity of a -as kinase can be reversibly blocked with an allele-specific inhibitor. Thus, analog-sensitive kinases can be effective tools for discovery of the cellular functions and phosphorylation targets of individual enzymes.

  abstract = {The wheat group has evolved through allopolyploidization, namely, through hybridization among species from the plant genera Aegilops and Triticum followed by genome doubling. This speciation process has been associated with ecogeographical expansion and with domestication. In the past few decades, we have searched for explanations for this impressive success. Our studies attempted to probe the bases for the wide genetic variation characterizing these species, which accounts for their great adaptability and colonizing ability. Central to our work was the investigation of how allopolyploidization alters genome structure and expression. We found in wheat that allopolyploidy accelerated genome evolution in two ways: (1) it triggered rapid genome alterations through the instantaneous generation of a variety of cardinal genetic and epigenetic changes (which we termed "revolutionary" changes), and (2) it facilitated sporadic genomic changes throughout the species' evolution (i.e., evolutionary changes), which are not attainable at the diploid level. Our major findings in natural and synthetic allopolyploid wheat indicate that these alterations have led to the cytological and genetic diploidization of the allopolyploids. These genetic and epigenetic changes reflect the dynamic structural and functional plasticity of the allopolyploid wheat genome. The significance of this plasticity for the successful establishment of wheat allopolyploids, in nature and under domestication, is discussed.},

  abstract = {The genetic basis of bipolar affective disorder remains opaque despite years of intensive investigation. One of the most serious difficulties for genetic research is the enormous phenotypic heterogeneity of psychiatric illnesses. As a response to this problem, geneticists have searched for alternative strategies to identify those individuals at genetic risk for developing the disorder. One approach is to use endophenotypes or intermediate traits. Gottesman and Gould (2003), in their discussion of endophenotypes, suggest five criteria that should be characteristic of a trait in order for it to qualify as an endophenotype. These five criteria are used in order to assess the viability of using measures of neuropsychological dysfunction as endophenotypes for genetic studies of bipolar disorder. A review of the literature suggests that executive dysfunction is characteristic of people with bipolar disorder in both the acute and chronic stages of the illness, that neurocognitive function is influenced by genetic factors and that neuropsychological deficits have been reported in the nonaffected relatives of bipolar probands. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether neuropsychological dysfunction co-segregates with affectively ill individuals. We conclude that the use of neurocognitive markers of bipolar illness suffers from a number of serious drawbacks but given the absence of more appropriate endophenotypes, the neuropsychological profiling of probands and their relatives may nevertheless prove to be a worthwhile exercise.

  abstract = {We examined the ability of eigenvalue tests to distinguish field-collected from random, assemblage structure data sets. Eight published time series of species abun- dances were used in the analysis, including data sets for: fishes, birds, mammals, stream benthos, and crabs. To test the efficacy of eigenvalue tests, we constructed 1000 randomly generated data sets for each real data set, whose means and variances were identical to the means and variances of the original data matrices. The data sets were then subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA) and eigenvalue tests used to identify significant ei- genvalues for both correlation and covariance matrix solutions. We also examined the effects of: (1) number of species (= number of variables), (2) number of samples (= rep- lication), and (3) variance structure, on the performance of the test. Using PCA's based on the correlation matrix and with sample sizes typically encountered in the field, the eigenvalue tests generally performed at the .05 level when a = .01. Slightly poorer results were obtained with the covariance matrix. Increasing the number of samples to at least three times the number of species generally gave a level coverage for an a level test (i.e., a = .05, .01). Increasing variance in the data set only affected test outcomes at levels of replication less than twice the number of species. We conclude that the eigenvalue tests can be used to detect patterns in PCA's of assemblage structure data, if the number of samples is at least three times the number of species and either a covariance or correlation matrix solution is used. It is assumed that these patterns represent ecologically meaningful patterns of variation.},

This symplastic connectivity, while straightforward to observe using fluorescent tracers, has proven difficult to quantify. We use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, combined with a mathematical model of symplastic diffusion, to assay plasmodesmata-mediated permeability in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root meristem in wild-type and transgenic lines, and under selected chemical treatments. The permeability measured for the wild type is nearly 10-times greater than previously reported. Plamodesmal permeability remains constant in seedlings treated with auxin (30 mM indoleacetic acid for 2 and 24 h; 100 nm indoleacetic acid for 2 h); however, permeability is diminished in two lines previously reported to have impaired plasmodesmal function as well as in wild-type seedlings treated for 24 h with 0.6 mM tryptophan. Moreover, plasmodesmal permeability is strongly altered by applied hydrogen peroxide within 2 h of treatment, being approximately doubled at a low concentration (0.6 mM) and nearly eliminated at a higher one (6 mM). These results reveal that the plasmodesmata in the root meristem carry a substantial flux of small molecules and that this flux is subject to rapid regulation.},

  abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) is a critical hormonal regulator of plant growth and defense. To advance our understanding of the architecture and dynamic regulation of the JA gene regulatory network, we performed a high-resolution RNA-Seq time series of methyl JA-treated Arabidopsis thaliana at 15 time points over a 16-h period. Computational analysis showed that MeJA induces a burst of transcriptional activity, generating diverse expression patterns over time that partition into distinct sectors of the JA response targeting specific biological processes. The presence of transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding motifs correlated with specific TF activity during temporal MeJA-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Insight into the underlying dynamic transcriptional regulation mechanisms was captured in a chronological model of the JA gene regulatory network. Several TFs, including MYB59 and bHLH27, were uncovered as early network components with a role in pathogen and insect resistance. Analysis of subnetworks surrounding the TFs ORA47, RAP2.6L, MYB59 and ANAC055, using transcriptome profiling of overexpressors and mutants, provided insights into their regulatory role in defined modules of the JA network. Collectively, our work illuminates the complexity of the JA gene regulatory network, pinpoints and validates previously unknown regulators, and provides a valuable resource for functional studies on JA signaling components in plant defense and development.},

Owing to this role, opportunistic microbial pathogens have evolved to exploit plasmodesmata as gateways to spread infection from cell to cell within the plant. However, although these pathogens have acquired the capacity to breach the plasmodesmal trafficking pathway, plants are unlikely to relinquish control over a structure essential for their survival so easily. In this review, we examine evidence that suggests plasmodesmata play an active role in plant immunity against viral, fungal and bacterial pathogens. We discuss how these pathogens differ in their lifestyles and infection modes, and present the defense strategies that plants have adopted to prevent the intercellular spread of an infection. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The shikimate pathway is often referred to as the com- mon aromatic biosynthetic pathway, even though nature does not synthesize a11 aromatic compounds by this route. This metabolic sequence converts the primary metabolites PEP and erythrose-4-P to chorismate, the last common precursor for the three aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp and for p-amino and p-hydroxy benzoate (Fig. 1). The shikimate pathway is found in bacteria, fungi, and plants. In monogastric animals, Phe and Trp are essential amino acids that have to come with the diet and Tyr is directly derived from Phe. Since bacteria use in excess of 90\% of their metabolic energy for protein biosynthesis, for most prokaryotes, the three aromatic amino acids represent nearly the entire output of aromatic biosynthesis, and reg- ulatory mechanisms for shikimate pathway activity are triggered by the intracellular concentrations of Phe, Tyr, and Trp. This is not so in higher plants, in which the aromatic amino acids are the precursors for a large variety of secondary metabolites with aromatic ring structures that often make up a substantial amount of the total dry weight of a plant. Among the many aromatic secondary metabo- lites are flavonoids, many phytoalexins, indole acetate, alkaloids such as morphine, UV light protectants, and, most important, lignin},

Using a combination of X?ray computed tomography (CT) and image?based modelling, we tested the accuracy of this spatial averaging by directly calculating plant water uptake for young wheat plants in two soil types. The root system was imaged using X?ray CT at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 d after transplanting. The roots were segmented using semi?automated root tracking for speed and reproducibility. The segmented geometries were converted to a mesh suitable for the numerical solution of Richards' equation. Richards' equation was parameterized using existing pore scale studies of soil hydraulic properties in the rhizosphere of wheat plants. Image?based modelling allows the spatial distribution of water around the root to be visualized and the fluxes into the root to be calculated. By comparing the results obtained through image?based modelling to spatially averaged models, the impact of root architecture and geometry in water uptake was quantified. We observed that the spatially averaged models performed well in comparison to the image?based models with 2\% difference in uptake. However, the spatial averaging loses important information regarding the spatial distribution of water near the root system.},

This communication has to be tightly regulated to ensure that cellular components such as organelles, macromolecules, hormones, or viruses leave the cell in a precisely organized way. During evolution, plants, animals, and fungi have developed similar ways of responding to this biological challenge. For example, in higher plants, plasmodesmata connect adjacent cells and allow communication to regulate differentiation and development. In animals, two main general structures that enable short- and long-range intercellular communication are known, namely gap junctions and tunneling nanotubes, respectively. Finally, filamentous fungi have also developed specialized structures called septal pores that allow intercellular communication via cytoplasmic flow. This review summarizes the underlying mechanisms for intercellular communication in these three eukaryotic groups and discusses its consequences for the regulation of differentiation and developmental processes.},

  abstract = {FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) is the plant cell surface receptor that perceives bacterial flagellin or flg22 peptide, initiates flg22-signaling responses, and contributes to bacterial growth restriction. Flg22 elicitation also leads to ligand-induced endocytosis and degradation of FLS2 within 1 h. Why plant cells remove this receptor precisely at the time during which its function is required remains mainly unknown. Here, we assessed in planta flg22-signaling competency in the context of ligand-induced degradation of endogenous FLS2 and chemical interference known to impede flg22-dependent internalization of FLS2 into endocytic vesicles. Within 1 h after an initial flg22 treatment, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf tissue was unable to reelicit flg22 signaling in a ligand-, time-, and dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that flg22-induced degradation of endogenous FLS2 may serve to desensitize cells to the same stimulus (homologous desensitization), likely to prevent continuous signal output upon repetitive flg22 stimulation. In addition to impeding ligand-induced FLS2 degradation, pretreatment with the vesicular trafficking inhibitors Wortmannin or Tyrphostin A23 impaired flg22-elicited reactive oxygen species production that was partially independent of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1. Interestingly, these inhibitors did not affect flg22-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, indicating the ability to utilize vesicular trafficking inhibitors to target different flg22-signaling responses. For Tyrphostin A23, reduced flg22-induced reactive oxygen species could be separated from the defect in FLS2 degradation. At later times (2 h) after the initial flg22 elicitation, recovery of FLS2 protein levels positively correlated with resensitization to flg22, indicating that flg22-induced new synthesis of FLS2 may prepare cells for a new round of monitoring the environment for flg22.},

We undertook a large-scale quantitative analysis to determine the genetic basis of the phenotypic diversity in wheat grain morphology. A high-throughput method was used to capture grain size and shape variation in multiple mapping populations, elite varieties, and a broad collection of ancestral wheat species. This analysis reveals that grain size and shape are largely independent traits in both primitive wheat and in modern varieties. This phenotypic structure was retained across the mapping populations studied, suggesting that these traits are under the control of a limited number of discrete genetic components. We identified the underlying genes as quantitative trait loci that are distinct for grain size and shape and are largely shared between the different mapping populations. Moreover, our results show a significant reduction of phenotypic variation in grain shape in the modern germplasm pool compared with the ancestral wheat species, probably as a result of a relatively recent bottleneck. Therefore, this study provides the genetic underpinnings of an emerging phenotypic model where wheat domestication has transformed a long thin primitive grain to a wider and shorter modern grain.},

Here we show that Oenothera drummondii flowers, exposed to the playback sound of a flying bee or to synthetic sound-signals at similar frequencies, produced sweeter nectar within 3 minutes, potentially increasing the chances of cross pollination. We found that the flowers vibrated mechanically in response to these sounds, suggesting a plausible mechanism where the flower serves as the plant's auditory sensory organ. Both the vibration and the nectar response were frequency-specific: the flowers responded to pollinator sounds, but not to higher frequency sound. Our results document for the first time that plants can rapidly respond to pollinator sounds in an ecologically relevant way. Sensitivity of plants to pollinator sound can affect plant-pollinator interactions in a wide range of ways: Plants could allocate their resources more adequately, focusing on the time of pollinator activity; pollinators would then be better rewarded per time unit; flower shape may be selected for its effect on hearing ability, and not only on signaling; and pollinators may evolve to make sounds that the flowers can hear. Finally, our results suggest that plants may be affected by other sounds as well, including antropogenic ones.},

  abstract = {Wheat is one of~the most widely grown crop in temperate climates for food and animal feed. In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations. In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in $\mu$CT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress. Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other economically important crop species.},

  abstract = {The turnover of callose ($\beta$-1,3-glucan) within cell walls is an essential process affecting many developmental, physiological and stress related processes in plants. The deposition and degradation of callose at the neck region of plasmodesmata (Pd) is one of the cellular control mechanisms regulating Pd permeability during both abiotic and biotic stresses. Callose accumulation at Pd is controlled by callose synthases (CalS; EC 2.4.1.34), endogenous enzymes mediating callose synthesis, and by $\beta$-1,3-glucanases (BG; EC 3.2.1.39), hydrolytic enzymes which specifically degrade callose. Transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of some CalSs and BGs are strongly controlled by stress signaling, such as that resulting from pathogen invasion. We review the role of Pd-associated callose in the regulation of intercellular communication during developmental, physiological, and stress response processes. Special emphasis is placed on the involvement of Pd-callose in viral pathogenicity. Callose accumulation at Pd restricts virus movement in both compatible and incompatible interactions, while its degradation promotes pathogen spread. Hence, studies on mechanisms of callose turnover at Pd during viral cell-to-cell spread are of importance for our understanding of host mechanisms exploited by viruses in order to successfully spread within the infected plant.},

  abstract = {Plasmodesmata provide symplastic continuity linking individual plant cells. However, specialized cells may be isolated, either by the absence of plasmodesmata or by down regulation of the cytoplasmic flux through these channels, resulting in the formation of symplastic domains. Maintenance of these domains may be essential for the coordination of growth and development. While cells in the center of the meristem divide slowly and remain undifferentiated, cells on the meristem periphery divide more frequently and respond to signals determining organ fate. Such symplastic domains were visualized within shoot apices of Arabidopsis, by monitoring fluorescent symplastic tracers (HPTS: 8-hydroxypyrene 1,3,6 trisulfonic acid and CF: carboxy fluorescein), Tracers were loaded through cut leaves and distributed throughout the whole plant. Confocal laser scanning microscopy on living Arabidopsis plants indicates that HPTS moves via the vascular tissue from leaves to the apex where the tracer exits the phloem and moves symplastically into surrounding cells. The distribution of HPTS was monitored in vegetative apices, and just prior to, during, and after the switch to production of flowers. The apices of vegetative plants loaded with HPTS had detectable amounts of tracer in the tunica layer of the meristem and in very young primordia, whereas the corpus of the meristem excluded tracer uptake. Fluorescence signal intensity decreased prior to the onset of flowering. Moreover, at approximately the time the plants were committed to flowering, HPTS was undetectable in the inflorescence meristem or young primordia, Later in development, after several secondary inflorescences and mature siliques appeared, inflorescence apices again showed tracer loading at levels comparable to that of vegetative apices, Thus, analysis of fluorescent tracer movement via plasmodesmata reveals there is distinct temporal and spatial regulation of symplastic domains at the apex, dependent on the developmental stage of the plant.},

Near-infrared spectroscopy is the state-of-the-art solution for this analytical demand, but it also has some limitations. Here, we present a novel, rapid, accurate procedure based on time domain-nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR), designed to simultaneously quantify a number of basic seed traits without any seed destruction. Using a low-field, benchtop (1) H-NMR instrument, the procedure gives a high-accuracy measurement of oil content (R(2) = 0.98), carbohydrate content (R(2) = 0.99), water content (R(2) = 0.98) and both fresh and dry weight of seeds/grains (R(2) = 0.99). The method requires a minimum of \~20 mg biomass per sample and thus enables to screen individual, intact seeds. When combined with an automated sample delivery system, a throughput of \~1400 samples per day is achievable. The procedure has been trialled as a proof of concept on cereal grains (collection of \~3000 accessions of Avena spp. curated at the IPK genebank). A mathematical multitrait selection approach has been designed to simplify the selection of outlying (most contrasting) accessions. To provide deeper insights into storage oil topology, some oat accessions were further analysed by three-dimensional seed modelling and lipid imaging. We conclude that the novel TD-NMR-based screening tool opens perspectives for breeding and plant biology in general.},

New PD structures were observed during early formation of PD and between phloem sieve elements and phloem pole pericycle cells in roots. Both observations challenge our current understanding of PD structure and function. Research into novel physiological responses, which are regulated by PD, indicates that we have not yet fully explored the potential contribution of PD to overall plant function. In this Viewpoint article, we summarize some of the recent advances in understanding the structure and function of PD and propose the challenges ahead for the community.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We sought to explore the interactions between roots and soil without disturbance and in four dimensions (i.e. 3-D plus time) using X-ray micro-computed tomography. METHODS: The roots of tomato Solanum lycopersicum 'Ailsa Craig' plants were visualized in undisturbed soil columns for 10 consecutive days to measure the effect of soil compaction on selected root traits including elongation rate. Treatments included bulk density (1.2 vs. 1.6 g cm(-3)) and soil type (loamy sand vs. clay loam). KEY RESULTS: Plants grown at the higher soil bulk density exploited smaller soil volumes (P  0.05) and exhibited reductions in root surface area (P  0.001), total root volume (P  0.001) and total root length (P  0.05), but had a greater mean root diameter (P  0.05) than at low soil bulk density. Swelling of the root tip area was observed in compacted soil (P  0.05) and the tortuosity of the root path was also greater (P  0.01). Root elongation rates varied greatly during the 10-d observation period (P  0.001), increasing to a maximum at day 2 before decreasing to a minimum at day 4. The emergence of lateral roots occurred later in plants grown in compacted soil (P  0.01). Novel rooting characteristics (convex hull volume, centroid and maximum width), measured by image analysis, were successfully employed to discriminate treatment effects. The root systems of plants grown in compacted soil had smaller convex hull volumes (P  0.05), a higher centre of mass (P  0.05) and a smaller maximum width than roots grown in uncompacted soil. CONCLUSIONS: Soil compaction adversely affects root system architecture, influencing resource capture by limiting the volume of soil explored. Lateral roots formed later in plants grown in compacted soil and total root length and surface area were reduced. Root diameter was increased and swelling of the root tip occurred in compacted soil.},

It is central to a number of areas such as information retrieval, pattern recognition, and statistical data analysis; many of the problems arising in these applications can involve several hundred or several thousand dimensions. We consider the nearest-neighbor problem for d-dimensional Euclidean space: we wish to pre-process a database of n points so that given a query point, one can efficiently determine its nearest neighbors in the database. There is a large literature on algorithms for this problem, in both the exact and approximate cases. The more sophisticated algorithms typically achieve a query time that is logarithmic in n at the expense of an exponential dependence on the dimension d; indeed, even the average-case analysis of heuristics such as k-d trees reveals an exponential dependence on d in the query time. In this work, we develop a new approach to the nearestneighbor problem, based on a method for combining randomly chosen one-dimensional projedions of the underlying point set. From this, we obtain the following two results. (i) An algorithm for finding e-approximate nearest neighbors with a query time of O((d log\^2 d)(d + log n)). (ii) An eps-approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm with near-linear storage and a query time that improves asymptotically on linear search in all dimensions.},

  volume = {360},
  issn = {10959203},
  doi = {10.1126/science.aar4142},
  abstract = {Some pathogens and pests deliver small RNAs (sRNAs) into host cells to suppress host immunity. Conversely, hosts also transfer sRNAs into pathogens and pests to inhibit their virulence. Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are transferred, especially from hosts to pathogens and pests, is still unknown. Here, we show that host Arabidopsis cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. Transferred host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, Arabidopsis has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen. S mall RNAs (sRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that silence genes with complementary sequences (1). Within an animal, sRNAs can be transported by extracellular vesicles, specific transmembrane proteins, high-density lipoprotein complexes, or gap junctions (2). Within a plant, sRNAs move from cell to cell, presumably through plasmodesmata, and travel systemically through vasculature (3). Remarkably, sRNAs also move between hosts and interacting organisms and induce gene silencing, a phenomenon called cross-kingdom/organism RNA interference (RNAi) (4-10). But how do mobile sRNAs travel across the boundaries between organisms of different taxonomic kingdoms? The gastro-intestinal parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus secretes exosomes, a class of extracellular vesicles, to transport microRNAs (miRNAs) into mam-malian cells to suppress host immunity (7). By contrast, the mechanism by which sRNAs are transported from hosts to interacting pathogens and pests is totally unknown. To investigate how host sRNAs move into interacting fungal cells and identify plant endogenous transferred sRNAs, we used the Arabidopsis-Botrytis cinerea pathosystem that displays bi-directional sRNA trafficking and cross-kingdom RNAi (6, 8, 11, 12). Because the cell wall compositions of plants and fungi are different, we developed a sequential protoplast purification method to isolate pure fungal cells from infected tissues (fig. S1). sRNA profiling of purified B. cinerea protoplasts identified 42 Arabidopsis sRNAs in all three biological replicates, using 40 normalized reads per million total reads as a cutoff (table S1). We performed sRNA profiling on total RNAs of Arabidopsis leaves as a control. Although the more abundant sRNAs were more likely to be transported (table S2), there is a clear selection in transferred sRNAs. Among the 42 transferred Arabidopsis sRNAs, 25 were lowly abundant and not among the top 100 sRNAs in the total sRNA libraries (tables S2 and S3). Despite being generated from the same TAS1c mRNA precursor and belong to the top 20 most abundant sRNAs from the total sRNA libraries, transacting small interfering RNA locus 1C-derived siRNA483 (TAS1c-siR483) but not TAS1c-siR585 was enriched in the fungal protoplasts (tables S2 and S3). Similarly , although TAS2-siR710 had 30 times higher reads in the total sRNA libraries than TAS2-siR453 that derived from the same TAS2 precursor , only TAS2-siR453 was present in the fungal protoplasts. Furthermore, Arabidopsis hetero-chromatic sRNAs that derived from intergenic regions, such as IGN-siR1 but not IGN-siR107, were enriched in B. cinerea cells, although IGN-siR107 accumulated to a higher level in the total sRNA libraries (tables S2 and S3). These results were validated by means of sRNA reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (Fig. 1A). Thus, host cells transferring endogenous sRNAs into fungal cells are not simply through concentration-dependent diffusion but possibly through a more selective process. Extracellular vesicles are implicated in systemic sRNA transport in animals (13). To test whether plants secrete vesicles to transfer sRNAs into fungal cells, we profiled vesicle sRNAs isolated from the extracellular apoplastic fluids of infected leaves. In all three biological replicates, TAS1c-siR483, TAS2-siR453, and IGN-siR1 accumulated to higher levels than TAS1c-siR585, TAS2-siR710, and IGN-siR107, respectively (Fig. 1B and tables S2 and S4). This was similar to fungal protoplast results. Of the 42 transferred host sRNAs, 31 (73.8\%) were present in vesicle libraries (table S4). These results support a positive correlation between the sRNA profiles from extracellular vesicles and the fungal cells. Nuclease protection assay showed that transferred host sRNAs were protected from nuclease digestion unless vesicles were ruptured with Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) (Fig. 1C) (7, 14), confirming that transferred sRNAs are indeed inside the vesicles instead of bound to the surface. These Fig. 1. Plant endogenous sRNAs are transferred into fungal cells via extracellular vesicles. (A) TAS1c-siR483, TAS2-siR453, IGN-siR1, and miRNA166 were detected by means of sRNA semiquantitative RT-PCR in B. cinerea protoplasts purified from B. cinerea-infected Col-0 Arabidopsis (Bc Col). As a negative control, cultured B. cinerea mixed with uninfected leaves was subjected to the same procedure (Bc Ctrl). (B) These host sRNAs were also in Arabidopsis extracellular vesicles. (C) Arabidopsis sRNAs were detected in micrococcal nuclease-treated extracellular vesicles. In (A) to (C), TAS1c-siR585, TAS2-siR710, IGN-siR107, miRNA822, and Actin genes were used as controls. The "total" lane indicates total RNAs from leaves. Similar results were obtained from two biological replicates.},

Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 \% of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR ``spared'' essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future.},

  abstract = {Plants respond to herbivory through various morphological, biochemicals, and molecular mechanisms to counter/offset the effects of herbivore attack. The biochemical mechanisms of defense against the herbivores are wide-ranging, highly dynamic, and are mediated both by direct and indirect defenses. The defensive compounds are either produced constitutively or in response to plant damage, and affect feeding, growth, and survival of herbivores. In addition, plants also release volatile organic compounds that attract the natural enemies of the herbivores. These strategies either act independently or in conjunction with each other. However, our understanding of these defensive mechanisms is still limited. Induced resistance could be exploited as an important tool for the pest management to minimize the amounts of insecticides used for pest control. Host plant resistance to insects, particularly, induced resistance, can also be manipulated with the use of chemical elicitors of secondary metabolites, which confer resistance to insects. By understanding the mechanisms of induced resistance, we can predict the herbivores that are likely to be affected by induced responses. The elicitors of induced responses can be sprayed on crop plants to build up the natural defense system against damage caused by herbivores. The induced responses can also be engineered genetically, so that the defensive compounds are constitutively produced in plants against are challenged by the herbivory. Induced resistance can be exploited for developing crop cultivars, which readily produce the inducible response upon mild infestation, and can act as one of components of integrated pest management for sustainable crop production.},

  abstract = {To quantify the diffusion constant of small molecules in the plant cell wall, fluorescence from carboxyfluorescein (CF) in the intact roots of Arabidopsis thaliana was recorded. Roots were immersed in a solution of the fluorescent dye and viewed through a confocal fluorescence microscope. These roots are sufficiently transparent that much of the apoplast can be imaged. The diffusion coefficient, D(cw), of CF in the cell wall was probed using two protocols: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss following perfusion with dye-free solution. Diffusion coefficients were obtained from the kinetics of the fluorescent transients and modelling apoplast geometry. Apoplastic diffusion constants varied spatially in the root. In the elongation zone and mature cortex, D(cw)=(3.2+/-1.4)x10(-11) m(2) s(-1), whereas in mature epidermis, D(cw)=(2.5+/-0.7)x10(-12) m(2) s(-1), at least an order of magnitude lower. Relative to the diffusion coefficient of CF in water, these represent reductions by approximately 1/15 and 1/195, respectively. The low value for mature epidermis is correlated with a suberin-like permeability barrier that was detected with either autofluorescence or berberine staining. This study provides a quantitative estimate of the permeability of plant cell walls to small organic acids-a class of compounds that includes auxin and other plant hormones. These measurements constrain models of solute transport, and are important for quantitative models of hormone signalling during plant growth and development.},

Since roots develop in strong interaction with the soil matrix, tools are required that can visualize and quantify root growth in opaque soil at best in 3D. Two modalities that are suited for such investigations are X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Due to the different physical principles they are based on, these modalities have their specific potentials and challenges for root phenotyping. We compared the two methods by imaging the same root systems grown in 3 different pot sizes with inner diameters of 34~mm, 56~mm or 81~mm. Both methods successfully visualized roots of two weeks old bean plants in all three pot sizes. Similar root images and almost the same root length were obtained for roots grown in the small pot, while more root details showed up in the CT images compared to MRI. For the medium sized pot, MRI showed more roots and higher root lengths whereas at some spots thin roots were only found by CT and the high water content apparently affected CT more than MRI. For the large pot, MRI detected much more roots including some laterals than CT. Both techniques performed equally well for pots with small diameters which are best suited to monitor root development of seedlings. To investigate specific root details or finely graduated root diameters of thin roots, CT was advantageous as it provided the higher spatial resolution. For larger pot diameters, MRI delivered higher fractions of the root systems than CT, most likely because of the strong root-to-soil contrast achievable by MRI. Since complementary information can be gathered with CT and MRI, a combination of the two modalities could open a whole range of additional possibilities like analysis of root system traits in different soil structures or under varying soil moisture.},

Transport through plasmodesmata is regulated not only by a fixed size-exclusion limit, but also by physiological and pathological adaptation. To understand plant cell communication, carbon allocation and pathogen attack, the capacities for a specific molecule to pass a specific cell-wall interface is an essential parameter. So far, the degree of cell coupling was derived from frequency and diameter of plasmodesmata in relevant tissues as assessed by electron microscopy of fixed material. However, plasmodesmata functionality and capacity can only be determined in live material, not from electron microscopy, which is static and prone to fixation artefacts. Plasmodesmata functionality was a few times assessed using fluorescent tracers with diffusion properties similar to cytosolic solutes. Here, we used three-dimensional photoactivation microscopy to quantify plasmodesmata-mediated cell-wall permeability between living Cucurbita maxima leaf mesophyll cells with caged fluorescein as tracer. For the first time, all necessary functional and anatomical data were gathered for each individual cell from three-dimensional time series. This approach utilized a confocal microscope equipped with resonant scanner, which provides the high acquisition speed necessary to record optical sections of whole cells and offers time resolution high enough to follow the kinetics of photoactivation. The results were compared to two-dimensional measurements, which are shown to give a good estimate of cell coupling adequate for homogenous tissues. The two-dimensional approach is limited whenever tissues interfaces are studied that couple different cell types with diverse cell geometries.},

The parent-infant relationship provides infants with their first social experiences, forming templates of what they can expect from others and how to best meet others' expectations. In this review, we focus on the neurobiology of parenting behavior, including our own functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain imaging experiments of parents. We begin with a discussion of background, perspectives and caveats for considering the neurobiology of parent-infant relationships. Then, we discuss aspects of the psychology of parenting that are significantly motivating some of the more basic neuroscience research. Following that, we discuss some of the neurohormones that are important for the regulation of social bonding, and the dysregulation of parenting with cocaine abuse. Then, we review the brain circuitry underlying parenting, proceeding from relevant rodent and nonhuman primate research to human work. Finally, we focus on a study-by-study review of functional neuroimaging studies in humans. Taken together, this research suggests that networks of highly conserved hypothalamic-midbrain-limbic-paralimbic-cortical circuits act in concert to support aspects of parent response to infants, including the emotion, attention, motivation, empathy, decision-making and other thinking that are required to navigate the complexities of parenting. Specifically, infant stimuli activate basal forebrain regions, which regulate brain circuits that handle specific nurturing and caregiving responses and activate the brain's more general circuitry for handling emotions, motivation, attention, and empathy-all of which are crucial for effective parenting. We argue that an integrated understanding of the brain basis of parenting has profound implications for mental health.},

Recent findings in the field suggest that defense signaling pathways are tightly linked to the regulation of PD, and the restriction of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication is an essential innate immune response to microbial pathogens. Moreover, several plasma membrane-bound signaling components, including receptor-like kinases that are known to have non-cell autonomous function or pathogen perception at the cell periphery, are found to also partition to PD. These findings hint at the novel role of PD as a signaling hub for both symplasmic and cross-membrane pathways.},

Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, optical projection tomography or X-ray absorption tomography have been used with various success, depending on the size and physical properties of the biological material. RESULTS X-ray in-line phase tomography was applied for the imaging of internal structures of maize seeds at early stages of development, when the cells are metabolically fully active and water is the main cell content. This 3D imaging technique with histology-like spatial resolution is demonstrated to reveal the anatomy of seed compartments with unequalled contrast by comparison with X-ray absorption tomography. An associated image processing pipeline allowed to quantitatively segment in 3D the four compartments of the seed (embryo, endosperm, nucellus and pericarp) from 7 to 21 days after pollination. CONCLUSION This work constitutes an innovative quantitative use of X-ray in-line phase tomography as a non-destructive fast method to perform virtual histology and extends the developmental stages accessible by this technique which had previously been applied in seed biology to more mature samples.},

  abstract = {Individual grain weight is a major yield component in wheat. To provide a comprehensive understanding of grain weight determination, the carpel size at anthesis, grain dry matter accumulation, grain water uptake and loss, grain morphological expansion, and final grain weight at different positions within spikelets were investigated in a recombinant inbred line mapping population of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\texttimes{}spelt (Triticum spelta L.). Carpel size, grain dry matter and water accumulation, and grain dimensions interacted strongly with each other. Furthermore, larger carpels, a faster grain filling rate, earlier and longer grain filling, more grain water, faster grain water absorption and loss rates, and larger grain dimensions were associated with higher grain weight. Frequent quantitative trait locus (QTL) coincidences between these traits were observed, particularly those on chromosomes 2A, 3B, 4A, 5A, 5DL, and 7B, each of which harboured 16-49 QTLs associated with 12 traits. Analysis of the allelic effects of coincident QTLs confirmed their physiological relationships, indicating that the complex but orderly grain filling processes result mainly from pleiotropy or the tight linkages of functionally related genes. After grain filling, distal grains within spikelets were smaller than basal grains, primarily due to later grain filling and a slower initial grain filling rate, followed by synchronous maturation among different grains. Distal grain weight was improved by increased assimilate availability from anthesis. These findings provide deeper insight into grain weight determination in wheat, and the high level of QTL coincidences allows simultaneous improvement of multiple grain filling traits in breeding.},

A high-resolution time course of genome-wide expression changes following challenge with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and the nonpathogenic mutant strain DC3000hrpA- allowed us to establish causal links between the activities of pathogen effectors and suppression of MTI and infer with high confidence a range of processes specifically targeted by effectors. Analysis of this information-rich data set with a range of computational tools provided insights into the earliest transcriptional events triggered by effector delivery, regulatory mechanisms recruited, and biological processes targeted. We show that the majority of genes contributing to disease or defense are induced within 6 h postinfection, significantly before pathogen multiplication. Suppression of chloroplast-associated genes is a rapid MAMP-triggered defense response, and suppression of genes involved in chromatin assembly and induction of ubiquitin-related genes coincide with pathogen-induced abscisic acid accumulation. Specific combinations of promoter motifs are engaged in fine-tuning the MTI response and active transcriptional suppression at specific promoter configurations by P. syringae.},

Despite its importance in main- taining plant integrity and plant defence, knowledge about the regulation of callose biosynthesis at its diverse sites of action within the plant is still limited. The moderately sized family of GSL (GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE) genes is predicted to encode callose synthases with a specific biological function and subcellular localization. Phosphorylation and directed translocation of callose synthases seem to be key post-translational mechanisms of enzymatic regulation, whereas transcriptional control of GSL genes might only have a minor function in response to biotic or abiotic stresses. Scope and Conclusions: Among the different sites of callose biosynthesis within the plant, particular attention has beenfocusedontheformation of callose in responsetopathogenattack.Here, callose isdepositedbetweentheplasma membrane and the cellwall to act as a physical barrier to stop or slowinvading pathogens. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is one of the best-studied models not only for general plant defence responses but also for the regulation of pathogen-induced callose biosynthesis. Callose synthase GSL5 (GLUCANSYNTHASE\textendash{}LIKE5) has been shown to be responsible for stress-induced callose deposition.Within the last decade of research into stress-induced callose, growing evidence has been found that the timing of callose deposition in the multilayered system of plant defence responses could be the key parameter for optimal effectiveness. This timing seems to be achieved through co-ordi- nated transport and formation of the callose synthase complex.},

They are the dates at which human groups began to routinely exploit wild varieties of wheat and barley, and when foragers first utilized technologies to pound and grind the hard, fibrous seeds of these and other plants to turn them into easily digestible foodstuffs. Here we report the earliest direct evidence for human processing of grass seeds, including barley and possibly wheat, in the form of starch grains recovered from a ground stone artefact from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Ohalo II in Israel. Associated evidence for an oven-like hearth was also found at this site, suggesting that dough made from grain flour was baked. Our data indicate that routine processing of a selected group of wild cereals, combined with effective methods of cooking ground seeds, were practiced at least 12,000 years before their domestication in southwest Asia.},

  abstract = {Domestication of plants and animals is the major factor underlying human civilization and is a gigantic evolutionary experiment of adaptation and speciation, generating incipient species. Wheat is one of the most important grain crops in the world, and consists mainly of two types: the hexaploid bread wheat Triticum aestivum accounting for about 95\% of world wheat production, and the tetraploid durum wheat T. durum accounting for the other 5\%. In this review, we summarize and discuss research on wheat domestication, mainly focusing on recent findings in genetics and genomics studies. T. aestivum originated from a cross between domesticated emmer wheat T. dicoccum and the goat grass Aegilops tauschii , most probably in the south and west of the Caspian Sea about 9,000 years ago. Wild emmer wheat has the same genome formula as durum wheat and has contributed two genomes to bread wheat, and is central to wheat domestication. Domestication has genetically not only transformed the brittle rachis, tenacious glume and non-free threshability, but also modified yield and yield components in wheat. Wheat domestication involves a limited number of chromosome regions, or domestication syndrome factors, though many relevant quantitative trait loci have been detected. On completion of the genome sequencing of diploid wild wheat T. urartu or Ae. tauschii domestication syndrome factors and other relevant genes could be isolated, and effects of wheat domestication could be determined. The achievements of domestication genetics and robust research programs in Triticeae genomics are of greatly help in conservation and exploitation of wheat germplasm and genetic improvement of wheat cultivars.},

  abstract = {Positional information is crucial for the determination of plant cell fates, and it is established based on coordinated cell-to-cell communication, which in turn is essential for plant growth and development. Plants have evolved a unique communication pathway, with tiny channels called plasmodesmata (PD) spanning the cell wall. PD interconnect most cells in the plant and generate a cytoplasmic continuum, to mediate short- and long-distance trafficking of various molecules. Cell-to-cell communication through PD plays a role in transmitting positional signals, however, the regulatory mechanisms of PD-mediated trafficking are still largely unknown. The induction and maintenance of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) depends on PDmediated cell-to-cell communication, hence, it is an optimal model for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication and its function in specifying cell fates. In this review, we summarize recent knowledge of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication in the SAM, and discuss mechanisms underlying molecular trafficking through PD and its role in plant development.},

Outlook 66 Acknowledgements 66 References 66 SUMMARY: Plasmodesmata (PD) are plasma membrane-lined pores that connect neighbouring plant cells, bridging the cell wall and establishing cytoplasmic and membrane continuity between cells. PD are dynamic structures regulated by callose deposition in a variety of stress and developmental contexts. This process crudely controls the aperture of the pore and thus the flux of molecules between cells. During pathogen infection, plant cells initiate a range of immune responses and it was recently identified that, following perception of fungal and bacterial pathogens, plant cells initially close their PD. Systemic defence responses depend on the spread of signals between cells, raising questions about whether PD are in different functional states during different immune responses. It is well established that viral pathogens exploit PD to spread between cells, but it has more recently been identified that protein effectors secreted by fungal pathogens can spread between host cells via PD. It is possible that many classes of pathogens specifically target PD to aid infection, which would infer antagonistic regulation of PD by host and pathogen. How PD regulation benefits both host immune responses and pathogen infection is an important question and demands that we examine the multicellular nature of plant-pathogen interactions.},

  abstract = {Further improvements to wheat yield potential will be essential to meet future food demand. As yield is related to the number of fertile florets and grains, an understanding of the basis of their generation is instrumental to raising yield. Based on (i) a strong positive association between the number of fertile florets or grains and spike dry weight at anthesis; and (ii) the finding that floret death occurs when spikes grow at maximum rate, it was always assumed that floret survival depends on the growth of the spike. However, this assumption was recently questioned, suggesting that assimilates diverted to the spike do not determine the number of florets and grains and that the onset of floret death may instead be a developmental process that is not associated with spike growth. In this study, the relationships between the fate of floret primordia and spike growth from six independent experiments that included different growing conditions (greenhouse/field experiments, growing seasons, photoperiod/shading treatments during the floret primordia phase) and diverse cultivar types (winter/spring, semi-dwarf/standard-height, photoperiod sensitive/insensitive) were re-analysed together. Onset of floret death was associated with the beginning of spike growth at the maximum rate in c. 80\% of the cases analysed; and the rate of floret death (the main determinant of floret survival) showed a negative quantitative relationship with spike weight at anthesis. As floret death and survival were shown to be linked to pre-anthesis spike growth, the strategy of focusing on traits associated with pre-anthesis spike growth when breeding to increase wheat yield potential further is valuable.},

  abstract = {Auxin has critical roles in plant growth, dependent upon its heterogeneous distribution in tissues. Exactly how auxin signalling and transport, and developmental processes such as growth coordinate to achieve the precise patterns of auxin observed experimentally is not well understood. Here we use mathematical modelling to examine the interplay between these effects and their contribution to formation of patterns in auxin distribution in plant tissues. Mathematical models describing auxin-related signalling pathway, PIN and AUX1 dynamics, auxin transport, and cell growth in plant tissues were derived. Models were analysed and solved numerically to examine the long-time behaviour and auxin distribution. Changes in auxin-related signalling processes were shown to be able to trigger transition between passage and spot type patterns in auxin distribution. The model was also shown to be able to generate isolated cells with oscillatory auxin levels which have been observed experimentally. Cell growth was shown to have strong influence on PIN polarisation and determination of auxin distribution patterns. Numerical simulation results indicate that auxin-related signalling processes can explain the different auxin distributions observed in plant tissues, whereas interplay between auxin transport and growth can explain the ‘reverse-fountain' pattern in auxin distribution observed at root tips.},

Approximately one-third of the Arabidopsis genome is differentially expressed during the first 48 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring before significant lesion development. We used computational tools to obtain a detailed chronology of the defense response against B. cinerea, highlighting the times at which signaling and metabolic processes change, and identify transcription factor families operating at different times after infection. Motif enrichment and network inference predicted regulatory interactions, and testing of one such prediction identified a role for TGA3 in defense against necrotrophic pathogens.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epigenetics is defined as mechanisms that regulate gene expression without base sequence alteration. One molecular basis is considered to be DNA cytosine methylation, which reversibly modifies DNA or chromatin structures. Although its correlation with epigenetic inheritance over generations has been circumstantially shown, evidence at the gene level has been limited. The present study aims to find genes whose methylation status directly correlates with inheritance of phenotypic changes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: DNA methylation in vivo was artificially reduced by treating rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) seeds with 5-azadeoxycytidine, and the progeny were cultivated in the field for  10 years. Genomic regions with changed methylation status were screened by the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphysm (MSAP) method, and cytosine methylation was directly scanned by the bisulfite mapping method. Pathogen infection with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, race PR2 was performed by the scissors-dip method on mature leaf blades.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: The majority of seedlings were lethal, but some survived to maturity. One line designated as Line-2 showed a clear marker phenotype of dwarfism, which was stably inherited by the progeny over nine generations. MSAP screening identified six fragments, among which two were further characterized by DNA blot hybridization and direct methylation mapping. One clone encoding a retrotransposon gag-pol polyprotein showed a complete erasure of 5-methylcytosines in Line-2, but neither translocation nor expression of this region was detectable. The other clone encoded an Xa21-like protein, Xa21G. In wild-type plants, all cytosines were methylated within the promoter region, whereas in Line-2, corresponding methylation was completely erased throughout generations. Expression of Xa21G was not detectable in wild type but was constitutive in Line-2. When infected with X. oryzae pv. oryzae, against which Xa21 confers resistance in a gene-for-gene manner, the progeny of Line-2 were apparently resistant while the wild type was highly susceptible without Xa21G expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that demethylation was selective in Line-2, and that promoter demethylation abolished the constitutive silencing of Xa21G due to hypermethylation, resulting in acquisition of disease resistance. Both hypomethylation and resistant trait were stably inherited. This is a clear example of epigenetic inheritance, and supports the idea of Lamarckian inheritance which suggested acquired traits to be heritable.},

We show here that the transcription factor TGA1.a contributes to disease development caused by B. cinerea in tomato by suppressing the expression of proteinase inhibitors I and II. Finally, we present evidence that the SA-signaling pathway contributes to disease development caused by another necrotrophic pathogen, Alternaria solani, in tomato. Disease development promoted by SA through NPR1 requires the TGA1.a transcription factor. These data highlight how necrotrophs manipulate the SAsignaling pathway to promote their disease in tomato.},

Cultivation of wild cereals such as Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) and Triticum diccocoides (wild emmer) started in southwest Asia. Despite the many studies on the origins of agriculture and plant domestication, surprisingly few studies have discussed the importance of the nutritional quality of barley and emmer wheat in their evolution. A comparison of domesticated forms of these cereals with their wild progenitors suggests an evolution towards bigger grains with higher glycemic loads in the form of higher relative starch content with lower relative protein, fiber and mineral contents. In this work we hypothesize that in addition to the simple explanation that larger grains emerged under domestication, complex and indirect effects such as increased glycemic index and sweet taste should also be taken into consideration.},

While useful measurements can be obtained by segmenting a whole plant from the background, they suggest that the increased range and precision of measurements made available by leaf-level segmentation makes this a problem well worth solving. A variety of approaches have been tried by biologists as well as computer vision researchers. This is an interdisciplinary area and the computer vision community has an important contribution to make.

The analysis begins by questioning a certain understanding, widespread in the literature of new surveillance technologies, of Foucaults conceptions of power and surveillance. In brief, this understanding privileges the surveillance of many by few, of us by them. We contend, instead, that Foucault stressed in diverse books and articles the nexus between power relations and practices of the care of the self. Hence, techniques of surveillance are necessarily related to practices of self-surveillance. This theoretical framework constitutes the basis for differentiating two historically distinct types of self-surveillance: the first, proper to disciplinary society, is promoted by normalizing power; the second is associated to the increasing relevance of the epidemiological concept of risk in the problematizing of health-related behaviors. Epidemiology of risk factors, medical testing and genetics are opening up a temporal gap between the diagnostic of illnesses/diseases and their subjective symptoms. This gap is equivalent to a space for individual pre-emptive action against possible illnesses/diseases.},

We then incorporate these parameters into a mathematical model of SHR and SCR, which shows that SHR reaches a steady state in minutes, while SCR and the SHR-SCR complex reach a steady-state between 18 and 24 hr.

This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

PDs are plasma membrane-lined channels spanning the cell wall between neighbouring cells, allowing the exchange of molecules by symplastic movement through them. This review focuses on developmental decisions that are coordinated by short- and long-distance communication of cells via PDs. We propose a model combining both apoplastic and symplastic signalling events via secreted ligands and their PD-localized receptor kinases which gate the symplastic transport of information molecules through PDs. Cell communities can thus coordinate cell-fate decisions non-cell autonomously by connecting or disconnecting symplastic subdomains. Here we concentrate on the establishment of such subdomains in the plant's primary meristems that serve to maintain long-lasting stem cell populations in the shoot and root apical meristems, and discuss how apoplastic signalling via transport of information molecules through PDs is integrated with symplastic feedback signalling events.},

However, in many regions of the world, their production has been adversely affected by drought. Although water scarcity is a severe abiotic constraint of legume crops productivity, it remains unclear how the effects of drought co-vary with legume species, soil texture, agroclimatic region, and drought timing. To address these uncertainties, we collected literature data between 1980 and 2014 that reported monoculture legume yield responses to drought under field conditions, and analyzed this data set using meta-analysis techniques. Our results showed that the amount of water reduction was positively related with yield reduction, but the extent of the impact varied with legume species and the phenological state during which drought occurred. Overall, lentil (Lens culinaris), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) were found to experience lower drought-induced yield reduction compared to legumes such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and green gram (Vigna radiate). Yield reduction was generally greater when legumes experienced drought during their reproductive stage compared to during their vegetative stage. Legumes grown in soil with medium texture also exhibited greater yield reduction compared to those planted on soil of either coarse or fine texture. In contrast, regions and their associated climatic factors did not significantly affect legume yield reduction. In the face of changing climate, our study provides useful information for agricultural planning and research directions for development of drought-resistant legume species to improve adaptation and resilience of agricultural systems in the drought-prone regions of the world.},

  abstract = {Above-ground biomass (AGB) is a basic agronomic parameter for field investigation and is frequently used to indicate crop growth status, the effects of agricultural management practices, and the ability to sequester carbon above and below ground. The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas. In this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors. These results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate floral staging is required to aid research into pollen and flower development, in particular male development. Pollen development is highly sensitive to stress and is critical for crop yields. Research into male development under environmental change is important to help target increased yields. This is hindered in monocots as the flower develops internally in the pseudostem. Floral staging studies therefore typically rely on destructive analysis, such as removal from the plant, fixation, staining and sectioning. This time-consuming analysis therefore prevents follow up studies and analysis past the point of the floral staging. RESULTS This study focuses on using X-ray $\mathrm{\mu}$CT scanning to allow quick and detailed non-destructive internal 3D phenotypic information to allow accurate staging of Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flowers. X-ray $\mathrm{\mu}$CT has previously relied on fixation methods for above ground tissue, therefore two contrast agents (Lugol's iodine and Bismuth) were observed in Arabidopsis and Barley in planta to circumvent this step. 3D models and 2D slices were generated from the X-ray $\mathrm{\mu}$CT images providing insightful information normally only available through destructive time-consuming processes such as sectioning and microscopy. Barley growth and development was also monitored over three weeks by X-ray $\mathrm{\mu}$CT to observe flower development in situ. By measuring spike size in the developing tillers accurate non-destructive staging at the flower and anther stages could be performed; this staging was confirmed using traditional destructive microscopic analysis. CONCLUSION The use of X-ray micro computed tomography ($\mathrm{\mu}$CT) scanning of living plant tissue offers immense benefits for plant phenotyping, for successive developmental measurements and for accurate developmental timing for scientific measurements. Nevertheless, X-ray $\mathrm{\mu}$CT remains underused in plant sciences, especially in above-ground organs, despite its unique potential in delivering detailed non-destructive internal 3D phenotypic information. This work represents a novel application of X-ray $\mathrm{\mu}$CT that could enhance research undertaken in monocot species to enable effective non-destructive staging and developmental analysis for molecular genetic studies and to determine effects of stresses at particular growth stages.},

  abstract = {Higher temperatures caused by future climate change will bring more frequent heat stress events and pose an increasing risk to global wheat production. Crop models have been widely used to simulate future crop productivity but are rarely tested with observed heat stress experimental datasets. Four wheat models (DSSAT-CERES-Wheat, DSSAT-Nwheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow) were evaluated with 4~years of environment-controlled phytotron experimental datasets with two wheat cultivars under heat stress at anthesis and grain filling stages. Heat stress at anthesis reduced observed grain numbers per unit area and individual grain size, while heat stress during grain filling mainly decreased the size of the individual grains. The observed impact of heat stress on grain filling duration, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, and grain protein concentration (GPC) varied depending on cultivar and accumulated heat stress. For every unit increase of heat degree days (HDD, degree days over 30~$^\circ$C), grain filling duration was reduced by 0.30\textendash{}0.60\%, total aboveground biomass was reduced by 0.37\textendash{}0.43\%, and grain yield was reduced by 1.0\textendash{}1.6\%, but GPC was increased by 0.50\% for cv Yangmai16 and 0.80\% for cv Xumai30. The tested crop simulation models could reproduce some of the observed reductions in grain filling duration, final total aboveground biomass, and grain yield, as well as the observed increase in GPC due to heat stress. Most of the crop models tended to reproduce heat stress impacts better during grain filling than at anthesis. Some of the tested models require improvements in the response to heat stress during grain filling, but all models need improvements in simulating heat stress effects on grain set during anthesis. The observed significant genetic variability in the response of wheat to heat stress needs to be considered through cultivar parameters in future simulation studies.},

  abstract = {Increasing cereal yield is needed to meet the projected increased demand for world food supply of about 70\% by 2050. Sirius, a process-based model for wheat, was used to estimate yield potential for wheat ideotypes optimized for future climatic projections for ten wheat growing areas of Europe. It was predicted that the detrimental effect of drought stress on yield would be decreased due to enhanced tailoring of phenology to future weather patterns, and due to genetic improvements in the response of photosynthesis and green leaf duration to water shortage. Yield advances could be made through extending maturation and thereby improve resource capture and partitioning. However the model predicted an increase in frequency of heat stress at meiosis and anthesis. Controlled environment experiments quantify the effects of heat and drought at booting and flowering on grain numbers and potential grain size. A current adaptation of wheat to areas of Europe with hotter and drier summers is a quicker maturation which helps to escape from excessive stress, but results in lower yields. To increase yield potential and to respond to climate change, increased tolerance to heat and drought stress should remain priorities for the genetic improvement of wheat. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

The results presented as scatter diagrams showed that there was an increase in grain size between early and later levels. This led to the question of whether or not the changes were due to the effects of domestication. The data provided an opportunity to evaluate the use of measurements as a method to identify morphological domestication from early farming sites. Results were compared to domesticated specimens from a site dating to the end of the seventh millennium situated in the same geographical area and it was found that the upper size range from the Neolithic levels corresponded well with domesticated grains. Data from some published sites was also plotted. The factors affecting grain size such as morphological domestication, charring, environmental factors and crop processing are discussed in relation to the results. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Chloroplast microsatellites (SSRs) are conserved within wheat species, yet are sufficiently polymorphic between and within species to be useful for evolutionary studies. This study describes the relationships among a very large set of accessions of Triticum urartu Thum. ex Gandil., T. dicoccoides (Korn. ex Asch. et Graebn.) Schweinf., T. dicoccon Schrank, T. durum Desf., T. spelta L., and T. aestivum L. s. str. based on their cpSSR genotypes. By characterising the chloroplast diversity in each wheat species in the evolutionary series, the impact on diversity of major evolutionary events such as domestication and polyploidyisation was assessed. We detected bottlenecks associated with domestication, polyploidisation and selection, yet these constrictions were partially offset by mutations in the chloroplast SSR loci that generated new alleles. The discrete cpSSR alleles and haplotypes observed in T. urartu and Aegilops tauschii, combined with other species specific polymorphisms, provide very strong evidence that concur with current opinion that neither species was the maternal and thus cytoplasmic donor for polyploid wheats. Synthetic hexaploid wheats possessed the same chloroplast haplotypes as their tetraploid progenitors demonstrating how the novel synthetic wheat lines have captured chloroplast diversity from the maternal parents, the chloroplast is maternally inherited and novel alleles are not created by genomic rearrangements triggered by the polyploidisation event.},

One specialized mechanism that plants have evolved involves transport through plasmodesmata (PD), but when and how transport of molecules via PD is regulated among individual cells remains largely unknown, particularly at the single-cell level. Here, we developed a tool for quantitatively analyzing cell-to-cell transport via PD at a single-cell level using protonemata of Physcomitrella patens and a photoconvertible fluorescent protein, Dendra2. In the filamentous protonemal tissues, one-dimensional intercellular communication can be observed easily. Using this system, we found that Dendra2 was directionally transported toward the apex of the growing protonemata. However, this directional transport could be eliminated by incubation in the dark or treatment with a metabolic inhibitor. Thus, we propose that directional transport of macromolecules can occur via PD in moss protonemata, and may be affected by the photosynthetic and metabolic activity of cells.},
