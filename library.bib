  abstract = {Plants respond to biotic stress by inducing a variety of responses, which not only protect against the immediate diseases but also provide immunity from future infections. One example is systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which provides long-lasting and broad-spectrum protection at the whole plant level. The induction of SAR prepares the plant for a more robust response to subsequent infections from related and unrelated pathogens. SAR involves the rapid generation of signals at the primary site of infection, which are transported to the systemic parts of the plant presumably via the phloem. SAR signal generation and perception requires an intact cuticle, a waxy layer covering all aerial parts of the plant. A chemically diverse set of SAR inducers has already been identified, including hormones (salicylic acid, methyl salicylate), primary/secondary metabolites (nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, glycerol-3-phosphate, azelaic acid, pipecolic acid, dihyroabetinal), fatty acid/lipid derivatives (18 carbon unsaturated fatty acids, galactolipids), and proteins (DIR1-Defective in Induced Resistance 1, AZI1-Azelaic acid Induced 1). Some of these are demonstrably mobile and the phloem loading routes for three of these SAR inducers is known. Here we discuss the recent findings related to synthesis, transport, and the relationship between these various SAR inducers.},

In the present study an attempt has been made to understand rice seed development within the panicle at different developmental stages using this technique. During the first phase of cell division the Hounsfield Unit (HU) value remained low, increased in the dry matter accumulation phase, and finally reached a maximum at the maturation stage. HU value and seed dry weight showed a linear relationship in the varieties studied. This relationship was confirmed subsequently using seven other varieties. This is therefore an easy, simple, and non-invasive technique which may help breeders to select the best varieties. In addition, it may also help farmers to optimize post-anthesis agronomic practices as well as deciding the crop harvest time for higher grain yield.},

In this work we apply Skilling's nested sampling to address both of these problems. Nested sampling is a Bayesian method for exploring parameter space that transforms a multi-dimensional integral to a 1D integration over likelihood space. This approach focusses on the computation of the marginal likelihood or evidence. The ratio of evidences of different models leads to the Bayes factor, which can be used for model comparison. We demonstrate how nested sampling can be used to reverse-engineer a system's behaviour whilst accounting for the uncertainty in the results. The effect of missing initial conditions of the variables as well as unknown parameters is investigated. We show how the evidence and the model ranking can change as a function of the available data. Furthermore, the addition of data from extra variables of the system can deliver more information for model comparison than increasing the data from one variable, thus providing a basis for experimental design.},

We do this by robustly estimating the tool center point from each acquired image. 3D reconstruction can then be performed by a simple shape-from-silhouette approach. In experiments we investigate runtimes, theoretically achievable accuracy, experimentally achieved accuracy, and show as a proof of principle that the proposed method is well sufficient for 3D seed phenotyping purposes.},

  abstract = {Representing data as points in a high-dimensional space, so as to use geometric methods for indexing, is an algorithmic technique with a wide array of uses. It is central to a number of areas such as information retrieval, pattern recognition, and statistical data analysis; many of the problems arising in these applications can involve several hundred or several thousand dimensions. We consider the nearest-neighbor problem for d-dimensional Euclidean space: we wish to pre-process a database of n points so that given a query point, one can efficiently determine its nearest neighbors in the database. There is a large literature on algorithms for this problem, in both the exact and approximate cases. The more sophisticated algorithms typically achieve a query time that is logarithmic in n at the expense of an exponential dependence on the dimension d; indeed, even the average-case analysis of heuristics such as k-d trees reveals an exponential dependence on d in the query time. In this work, we develop a new approach to the nearestneighbor problem, based on a method for combining randomly chosen one-dimensional projedions of the underlying point set. From this, we obtain the following two results. (i) An algorithm for finding e-approximate nearest neighbors with a query time of O((d log\^2 d)(d + log n)). (ii) An eps-approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm with near-linear storage and a query time that improves asymptotically on linear search in all dimensions.},

Although altered expression of cell-cycle genes frequently leads to altered organ growth, there are many examples where manipulation of the division machinery leads to a limited outcome at the level of organ form, despite changes in constituent cell size. One possibility, which has been under-explored, is that altered division patterns resulting from manipulation of cell-cycle gene expression alter the physiology of the organ, and that this has an effect on growth. We performed a series of experiments on retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR), a well characterized regulator of the cell cycle, to investigate the outcome of altered cell division on leaf physiology. Our approach involved combination of high-resolution microCT imaging and physiological analysis with a transient gene induction system, providing a powerful approach for the study of developmental physiology. Our investigation identifies a new role for RBR in mesophyll differentiation that affects tissue porosity and the distribution of air space within the leaf. The data demonstrate the importance of RBR in early leaf development and the extent to which physiology adapts to modified cellular architecture resulting from altered cell-cycle gene expression.},

The aim of this paper is to examine the genotypic variability of leaf chlorophyll, stem water-soluble carbohydrate content and carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$13C), and their relationship with grain yield (GY) and other agronomical traits, under contrasting water conditions in a Mediterranean environment. The study was performed on a large collection of 384 wheat genotypes grown under water stress (WS, rainfed), mild water stress (MWS, deficit irrigation) and full irrigation (FI). The average GY of two growing seasons was 2.4, 4.8 and 8.9 Mg ha-1 under WS, MWS and FI, respectively. Chlorophyll content at anthesis was positively correlated with GY (except under FI in 2011) and the agronomical components kernels per spike (KS) and thousand kernel weight (TKW). The WSC content at anthesis (WSCCa) was negatively correlated with spikes per square meter (SM2), but positively correlated with KS and TKW under WS and FI conditions. As a consequence, the relationships between WSCCa with GY were low or not significant. Therefore, selecting for high stem WSC would not necessary lead to genotypes of GY potential. The relationship between $\Delta$13C and GY was positive under FI and MWS but negative under severe WS (in 2011), indicating higher water use under yield potential and MWS conditions.},

Molecular genetics and archaeological data have allowed the reconstruction of plausible domestication scenarios leading to modern cultivars. For diploid einkorn and tetraploid durum wheat, a single domestication event has likely occurred in the Karacadag Mountains, Turkey. Following a cross between tetraploid durum and diploid T. tauschii, the resultant hexaploid bread wheat was domesticated and disseminated around the Caucasian region. These polyploidisation events facilitated wheat domestication and created genetic bottlenecks, which excluded potentially adaptive alleles. With the urgent need to accelerate genetic progress to confront the challenges of climate change and sustainable agriculture, wild ancestors and old landraces represent a reservoir of underexploited genetic diversity that may be utilized through modern breeding methods. Understanding domestication processes may thus help identifying new strategies. \textcopyright{} 2011 Acad\'emie des sciences.},

Four wheat models (DSSAT-CERES-Wheat, DSSAT-Nwheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow) were evaluated with 4 years of environment-controlled phytotron experimental datasets with two wheat cultivars under heat stress at anthesis and grain filling stages. Heat stress at anthesis reduced observed grain numbers per unit area and individual grain size, while heat stress during grain filling mainly decreased the size of the individual grains. The observed impact of heat stress on grain filling duration, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, and grain protein concentration (GPC) varied depending on cultivar and accumulated heat stress. For every unit increase of heat degree days (HDD, degree days over 30 $^\circ$C), grain filling duration was reduced by 0.30\textendash{}0.60\%, total aboveground biomass was reduced by 0.37\textendash{}0.43\%, and grain yield was reduced by 1.0\textendash{}1.6\%, but GPC was increased by 0.50\% for cv Yangmai16 and 0.80\% for cv Xumai30. The tested crop simulation models could reproduce some of the observed reductions in grain filling duration, final total aboveground biomass, and grain yield, as well as the observed increase in GPC due to heat stress. Most of the crop models tended to reproduce heat stress impacts better during grain filling than at anthesis. Some of the tested models require improvements in the response to heat stress during grain filling, but all models need improvements in simulating heat stress effects on grain set during anthesis. The observed significant genetic variability in the response of wheat to heat stress needs to be considered through cultivar parameters in future simulation studies.},

  abstract = {Increasing cereal yield is needed to meet the projected increased demand for world food supply of about 70\% by 2050. Sirius, a process-based model for wheat, was used to estimate yield potential for wheat ideotypes optimized for future climatic projections for ten wheat growing areas of Europe. It was predicted that the detrimental effect of drought stress on yield would be decreased due to enhanced tailoring of phenology to future weather patterns, and due to genetic improvements in the response of photosynthesis and green leaf duration to water shortage. Yield advances could be made through extending maturation and thereby improve resource capture and partitioning. However the model predicted an increase in frequency of heat stress at meiosis and anthesis. Controlled environment experiments quantify the effects of heat and drought at booting and flowering on grain numbers and potential grain size. A current adaptation of wheat to areas of Europe with hotter and drier summers is a quicker maturation which helps to escape from excessive stress, but results in lower yields. To increase yield potential and to respond to climate change, increased tolerance to heat and drought stress should remain priorities for the genetic improvement of wheat. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Grain size and grain number constitute 2 important components of grain yield. In particular, the grain size also influences the end-use quality (e.g., flour yield and protein content) and attracts consumer preference. These 2 traits are also the components of the domestication syndrome of crop plants. A number of important studies have recently been conducted to understand the genetic and molecular basis of these 2 important yield-contributing traits. Information generated from these studies was collected and synthesized for the benefit of plant biologists, particularly plant breeders. In the present article, this information is briefly reviewed and the prospects of using this information for improvement of grain productivity in crop plants are discussed. R\'esum\'e : La taille et le nombre de grains constituent 2 composantes importantes du rendement. De plus, la taille des grains influence \'egalement la qualit\'e (rendement en farine, contenu prot\'eique) et repr\'esente un attrait aux yeux des consommateurs. Ces 2 caract\`eres font aussi partie du syndrome de la domestication chez les plantes. Plusieurs \'etudes importantes ont r\'ecemment permis de mieux comprendre les assises g\'en\'etiques et mol\'eculaires de ces 2 importants caract\`eres contribuant au rendement.

Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, optical projection tomography or X-ray absorption tomography have been used with various success, depending on the size and physical properties of the biological material. RESULTS X-ray in-line phase tomography was applied for the imaging of internal structures of maize seeds at early stages of development, when the cells are metabolically fully active and water is the main cell content. This 3D imaging technique with histology-like spatial resolution is demonstrated to reveal the anatomy of seed compartments with unequalled contrast by comparison with X-ray absorption tomography. An associated image processing pipeline allowed to quantitatively segment in 3D the four compartments of the seed (embryo, endosperm, nucellus and pericarp) from 7 to 21 days after pollination. CONCLUSION This work constitutes an innovative quantitative use of X-ray in-line phase tomography as a non-destructive fast method to perform virtual histology and extends the developmental stages accessible by this technique which had previously been applied in seed biology to more mature samples.},

  abstract = {The shikimate pathway is often referred to as the com- mon aromatic biosynthetic pathway, even though nature does not synthesize a11 aromatic compounds by this route. This metabolic sequence converts the primary metabolites PEP and erythrose-4-P to chorismate, the last common precursor for the three aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp and for p-amino and p-hydroxy benzoate (Fig. 1). The shikimate pathway is found in bacteria, fungi, and plants. In monogastric animals, Phe and Trp are essential amino acids that have to come with the diet and Tyr is directly derived from Phe. Since bacteria use in excess of 90\% of their metabolic energy for protein biosynthesis, for most prokaryotes, the three aromatic amino acids represent nearly the entire output of aromatic biosynthesis, and reg- ulatory mechanisms for shikimate pathway activity are triggered by the intracellular concentrations of Phe, Tyr, and Trp. This is not so in higher plants, in which the aromatic amino acids are the precursors for a large variety of secondary metabolites with aromatic ring structures that often make up a substantial amount of the total dry weight of a plant. Among the many aromatic secondary metabo- lites are flavonoids, many phytoalexins, indole acetate, alkaloids such as morphine, UV light protectants, and, most important, lignin},

By characterising the chloroplast diversity in each wheat species in the evolutionary series, the impact on diversity of major evolutionary events such as domestication and polyploidyisation was assessed. We detected bottlenecks associated with domestication, polyploidisation and selection, yet these constrictions were partially offset by mutations in the chloroplast SSR loci that generated new alleles. The discrete cpSSR alleles and haplotypes observed in T. urartu and Aegilops tauschii, combined with other species specific polymorphisms, provide very strong evidence that concur with current opinion that neither species was the maternal and thus cytoplasmic donor for polyploid wheats. Synthetic hexaploid wheats possessed the same chloroplast haplotypes as their tetraploid progenitors demonstrating how the novel synthetic wheat lines have captured chloroplast diversity from the maternal parents, the chloroplast is maternally inherited and novel alleles are not created by genomic rearrangements triggered by the polyploidisation event.},

  abstract = {The large numbers of samples processed in breeding and biodiversity programmes require the development of efficient methods for the nondestructive evaluation of basic seed properties. Near-infrared spectroscopy is the state-of-the-art solution for this analytical demand, but it also has some limitations. Here, we present a novel, rapid, accurate procedure based on time domain-nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR), designed to simultaneously quantify a number of basic seed traits without any seed destruction. Using a low-field, benchtop (1) H-NMR instrument, the procedure gives a high-accuracy measurement of oil content (R(2) = 0.98), carbohydrate content (R(2) = 0.99), water content (R(2) = 0.98) and both fresh and dry weight of seeds/grains (R(2) = 0.99). The method requires a minimum of $\sim$20 mg biomass per sample and thus enables to screen individual, intact seeds. When combined with an automated sample delivery system, a throughput of $\sim$1400 samples per day is achievable. The procedure has been trialled as a proof of concept on cereal grains (collection of $\sim$3000 accessions of Avena spp. curated at the IPK genebank). A mathematical multitrait selection approach has been designed to simplify the selection of outlying (most contrasting) accessions. To provide deeper insights into storage oil topology, some oat accessions were further analysed by three-dimensional seed modelling and lipid imaging. We conclude that the novel TD-NMR-based screening tool opens perspectives for breeding and plant biology in general.},

This paper reports QTL analyses of kernel morphology in two hexaploid wheat mapping populations, grown in NY and CA. Kernel morphology was evaluated through a new and improved method, combining measurements from two orthogonal pictures. Single marker regression showed that several genomic positions, scattered through the genome, were related to kernel size and shape, in both populations. The direction of allele effects was consistent between environments, although the LOD scores varied considerably. Composite interval mapping revealed QTLs on all seven homoeologous groups, considering both populations. For the QTLs detected through this method, the signal and magnitude of additive effects were similar between environments, indicating small QTL \texttimes{} environment interaction. In the population W7984 \texttimes{} Opata 85, the strongest signal was detected on the chromosome 5B, for kernel length. In the population AC Reed \texttimes{} Grandin, the most important QTLs were detected on chromosome 2D, affecting the lateral dimensions of the kernel. This study agreed with previous reports that the genetic control of kernel length and width are largely independent. Additionally, it was shown that QTLs detected on different mapping populations, with identical evaluation methods, can be very distinct. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Individual grain weight is a major yield component in wheat. To provide a comprehensive understanding of grain weight determination, the carpel size at anthesis, grain dry matter accumulation, grain water uptake and loss, grain morphological expansion, and final grain weight at different positions within spikelets were investigated in a recombinant inbred line mapping population of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\texttimes{}spelt (Triticum spelta L.). Carpel size, grain dry matter and water accumulation, and grain dimensions interacted strongly with each other. Furthermore, larger carpels, a faster grain filling rate, earlier and longer grain filling, more grain water, faster grain water absorption and loss rates, and larger grain dimensions were associated with higher grain weight. Frequent quantitative trait locus (QTL) coincidences between these traits were observed, particularly those on chromosomes 2A, 3B, 4A, 5A, 5DL, and 7B, each of which harboured 16-49 QTLs associated with $\backslash$textgreater12 traits. Analysis of the allelic effects of coincident QTLs confirmed their physiological relationships, indicating that the complex but orderly grain filling processes result mainly from pleiotropy or the tight linkages of functionally related genes. After grain filling, distal grains within spikelets were smaller than basal grains, primarily due to later grain filling and a slower initial grain filling rate, followed by synchronous maturation among different grains. Distal grain weight was improved by increased assimilate availability from anthesis. These findings provide deeper insight into grain weight determination in wheat, and the high level of QTL coincidences allows simultaneous improvement of multiple grain filling traits in breeding.},

Environmental conditions such as moisture deficit and high temperatures during the growing period affect the grain yield and grain characteristics of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The aim of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain yield and grain quality traits using a Drysdale/Gladius bread wheat mapping population grown under a range of environmental conditions in Australia and Mexico. In general, yield and grain quality were reduced in environments exposed to drought and/or heat stress. Despite large effects of known photoperiod-sensitivity loci (Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1) on crop development, grain yield and grain quality traits, it was possible to detect QTL elsewhere in the genome. Some of these QTL were detected consistently across environments. A locus on chromosome 6A (TaGW2) that is known to be associated with grain development was associated with grain width, thickness and roundness. The grain hardness (Ha) locus on chromosome 5D was associated with particle size index and flour extraction and a region on chromosome 3B was associated with grain width, thickness, thousand grain weight and yield. The genetic control of grain length appeared to be largely independent of the genetic control of the other grain dimensions. As expected, effects on grain yield were detected at loci that also affected yield components. Some QTL displayed QTL-by-environment interactions, with some having effects only in environments subject to water limitation and/or heat stress.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s).Background: Accurate floral staging is required to aid research into pollen and flower development, in particular male development. Pollen development is highly sensitive to stress and is critical for crop yields. Research into male development under environmental change is important to help target increased yields. This is hindered in monocots as the flower develops internally in the pseudostem. Floral staging studies therefore typically rely on destructive analysis, such as removal from the plant, fixation, staining and sectioning. This time-consuming analysis therefore prevents follow up studies and analysis past the point of the floral staging. Results: This study focuses on using X-ray $\mu$CT scanning to allow quick and detailed non-destructive internal 3D phenotypic information to allow accurate staging of Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flowers. X-ray $\mu$CT has previously relied on fixation methods for above ground tissue, therefore two contrast agents (Lugol's iodine and Bismuth) were observed in Arabidopsis and Barley in planta to circumvent this step. 3D models and 2D slices were generated from the X-ray $\mu$CT images providing insightful information normally only available through destructive time-consuming processes such as sectioning and microscopy. Barley growth and development was also monitored over three weeks by X-ray $\mu$CT to observe flower development in situ. By measuring spike size in the developing tillers accurate non-destructive staging at the flower and anther stages could be performed; this staging was confirmed using traditional destructive microscopic analysis. Conclusion: The use of X-ray micro computed tomography ($\mu$CT) scanning of living plant tissue offers immense benefits for plant phenotyping, for successive developmental measurements and for accurate developmental timing for scientific measurements. Nevertheless, X-ray $\mu$CT remains underused in plant sciences, especially in above-ground organs, despite its unique potential in delivering detailed non-destructive internal 3D phenotypic information. This work represents a novel application of X-ray $\mu$CT that could enhance research undertaken in monocot species to enable effective non-destructive staging and developmental analysis for molecular genetic studies and to determine effects of stresses at particular growth stages.},

  abstract = {Wheat is one of the most widely grown crop in temperate climates for food and animal feed. In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations. In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in $\mu$CT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress. Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other economically important crop species.},

Statistical hypothesis testing, in which the null hypothesis about the properties of a population is almost always known a priori to be false, is contrasted with scientific hypothesis testing, which examines a credible null hypothesis about phenomena in nature.

We undertook a large-scale quantitative analysis to determine the genetic basis of the phenotypic diversity in wheat grain morphology. A high-throughput method was used to capture grain size and shape variation in multiple mapping populations, elite varieties, and a broad collection of ancestral wheat species. This analysis reveals that grain size and shape are largely independent traits in both primitive wheat and in modern varieties. This phenotypic structure was retained across the mapping populations studied, suggesting that these traits are under the control of a limited number of discrete genetic components. We identified the underlying genes as quantitative trait loci that are distinct for grain size and shape and are largely shared between the different mapping populations. Moreover, our results show a significant reduction of phenotypic variation in grain shape in the modern germplasm pool compared with the ancestral wheat species, probably as a result of a relatively recent bottleneck. Therefore, this study provides the genetic underpinnings of an emerging phenotypic model where wheat domestication has transformed a long thin primitive grain to a wider and shorter modern grain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We sought to explore the interactions between roots and soil without disturbance and in four dimensions (i.e. 3-D plus time) using X-ray micro-computed tomography. METHODS: The roots of tomato Solanum lycopersicum 'Ailsa Craig' plants were visualized in undisturbed soil columns for 10 consecutive days to measure the effect of soil compaction on selected root traits including elongation rate. Treatments included bulk density (1.2 vs. 1.6 g cm(-3)) and soil type (loamy sand vs. clay loam). KEY RESULTS: Plants grown at the higher soil bulk density exploited smaller soil volumes (P $\backslash$textless 0.05) and exhibited reductions in root surface area (P $\backslash$textless 0.001), total root volume (P $\backslash$textless 0.001) and total root length (P $\backslash$textless 0.05), but had a greater mean root diameter (P $\backslash$textless 0.05) than at low soil bulk density. Swelling of the root tip area was observed in compacted soil (P $\backslash$textless 0.05) and the tortuosity of the root path was also greater (P $\backslash$textless 0.01). Root elongation rates varied greatly during the 10-d observation period (P $\backslash$textless 0.001), increasing to a maximum at day 2 before decreasing to a minimum at day 4. The emergence of lateral roots occurred later in plants grown in compacted soil (P $\backslash$textless 0.01). Novel rooting characteristics (convex hull volume, centroid and maximum width), measured by image analysis, were successfully employed to discriminate treatment effects. The root systems of plants grown in compacted soil had smaller convex hull volumes (P $\backslash$textless 0.05), a higher centre of mass (P $\backslash$textless 0.05) and a smaller maximum width than roots grown in uncompacted soil. CONCLUSIONS: Soil compaction adversely affects root system architecture, influencing resource capture by limiting the volume of soil explored. Lateral roots formed later in plants grown in compacted soil and total root length and surface area were reduced. Root diameter was increased and swelling of the root tip occurred in compacted soil.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional reprogramming is integral to effective plant defense. Pathogen effectors act transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally to suppress defense responses. A major challenge to understanding disease and defense responses is discriminating between transcriptional reprogramming associated with microbial-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity (MTI) and that orchestrated by effectors. A high-resolution time course of genome-wide expression changes following challenge with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and the nonpathogenic mutant strain DC3000hrpA- allowed us to establish causal links between the activities of pathogen effectors and suppression of MTI and infer with high confidence a range of processes specifically targeted by effectors. Analysis of this information-rich data set with a range of computational tools provided insights into the earliest transcriptional events triggered by effector delivery, regulatory mechanisms recruited, and biological processes targeted. We show that the majority of genes contributing to disease or defense are induced within 6 h postinfection, significantly before pathogen multiplication. Suppression of chloroplast-associated genes is a rapid MAMP-triggered defense response, and suppression of genes involved in chromatin assembly and induction of ubiquitin-related genes coincide with pathogen-induced abscisic acid accumulation. Specific combinations of promoter motifs are engaged in fine-tuning the MTI response and active transcriptional suppression at specific promoter configurations by P. syringae.GlossaryMAMPmicrobial-associated molecular patternPRRpattern recognition receptorMTIMAMP-triggered immunityETIeffector-triggered immunityETSeffector-triggered susceptibilityT3SStype III secretion systemcfucolony-forming unithpihours postinfiltrationDEGdifferentially expressed geneFDRfalse discovery rateGP2SGaussian Process two-sample test modeling time seriesMAANOVAMicroarray Analysis of VarianceGOGene OntologySAsalicylic acidJAjasmonic acidTFtranscription factorPDIprotein disulfide isomeraseABAabscisic acidCSICausal Structure IdentificationPSSMposition-specific scoring matrice},

However, the timing and synchrony of male and female flowering in wheat is a crucial determinant of seed set and may be an important factor affecting gene flow and resilience to climate change. Here, a methodology is presented for assessing the timing and synchrony of flowering in wheat, Triticum aestivum. From the onset of flowering until the end of anthesis, the anther and stigma activity of each floret was assessed on the first five developing ears in potted plants grown under ambient conditions and originating from oParagon' or oSpark-Rialto' backgrounds. At harvest maturity, seed presence, size and weight was recorded for each floret scored. The synchrony between pollen dehiscence and stigma collapse within a flower was dependent on its relative position in a spike and within a floret. Determined on the basis of synchrony within each flower, the level of pollination by pollen originating from other flowers reached approx. 30 and did not change throughout the duration of flowering. A modelling exercise parameterized by flowering observations indicated that the temporal and spatial variability of anther activity within and between spikes may influence the relative resilience of wheat to sudden, extreme climatic events which has direct relevance to predicted future climate scenarios in the UK.},

Here, we show that two chitooligosaccharides, chitin and chitosan, act as PAMPs in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) as they elicit immune signalling events, defense gene expression and resistance against fungal diseases. To identify their cognate receptors, the grapevine family of LysM receptor kinases (LysM-RKs) was annotated and their gene expression profiles were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis clearly distinguished three V. vinifera LysM-RKs (VvLYKs) located in the same clade as the Arabidopsis CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE1 (AtCERK1), which mediates chitin-induced immune responses. The Arabidopsis mutant Atcerk1, impaired in chitin perception, was transformed with these three putative orthologous genes encoding VvLYK1-1, -2, or -3 to determine if they would complement the loss of AtCERK1 function. Our results provide evidence that VvLYK1-1 and VvLYK1-2, but not VvLYK1-3, functionally complement the Atcerk1 mutant by restoring chitooligosaccharide-induced MAPK activation and immune gene expression. Moreover, expression of VvLYK1-1 in Atcerk1 restored penetration resistance to the non-adapted grapevine powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator). On the whole, our results indicate that the grapevine VvLYK1-1 and VvLYK1-2 participate in chitin- and chitosan-triggered immunity and that VvLYK1-1 plays an important role in basal resistance against E. necator.},

  abstract = {Summary Plant cells are connected through plasmodesmata (PD), membrane-lined channels that allow symplastic movement of molecules between cells. However, little is known about the role of PD-mediated signaling during plant morphogenesis. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis gene, CALS3/GSL12. Gain-of-function mutations in CALS3 result in increased accumulation of callose ($\beta$-1,3-glucan) at the PD, a decrease in PD aperture, defects in root development, and reduced intercellular trafficking. Enhancement of CALS3 expression during phloem development suppressed loss-of-function mutations in the phloem abundant callose synthase, CALS7 indicating that CALS3 is a bona fide callose synthase. CALS3 alleles allowed us to spatially and temporally control the PD aperture between plant tissues. Using this tool, we are able to show that movement of the transcription factor SHORT-ROOT and microRNA165 between the stele and the endodermis is PD dependent. Taken together, we conclude that regulated callose biosynthesis at PD is essential for cell signaling.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, membrane contact sites (MCS) allow direct communication between organelles. Plants have evolved unique MCS, the plasmodesmata intercellular pores, which combine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - plasma membrane (PM) contacts with regulation of cell-to-cell signalling. The molecular mechanism and function of membrane tethering within plasmodesmata remains unknown. Here we show that the Multiple C2 domains and Transmembrane region Protein (MCTP) family, key regulators of cell-to-cell signalling in plants, act as ER - PM tethers specifically at plasmodesmata. We report that MCTPs are core plasmodesmata proteins that insert into the ER via their transmembrane region whilst their C2 domains dock to the PM through interaction with anionic phospholipids. A mctp3/4 loss-of-function mutant induces plant developmental defects while MCTP4 expression in a yeast $\Delta$tether mutant partially restores ER-PM tethering. Our data suggest that MCTPs are unique membrane tethers controlling both ER-PM contacts and cell-cell signalling.},

  abstract = {Rapid, long-distance signaling in plants A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses. Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor\textendash{}like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf. Science, this issue p. 1112; see also p. 1068 Animals require rapid, long-range molecular signaling networks to integrate sensing and response throughout their bodies. The amino acid glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, facilitating long-range information exchange via activation of glutamate receptor channels. Similarly, plants sense local signals, such as herbivore attack, and transmit this information throughout the plant body to rapidly activate defense responses in undamaged parts. Here we show that glutamate is a wound signal in plants. Ion channels of the GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR\textendash{}LIKE family act as sensors that convert this signal into an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration that propagates to distant organs, where defense responses are then induced. Wounded plant cells leak l-glutamate, triggering plant-wide Ca2+ signaling events through glutamate receptor\textendash{}like channels.

  abstract = {We have compared the movement of a series of fluorescent tracers of increasing molecular weight injected into the cytoplasm in the epidermal cells of leaves of Egeria densa Planch. In general, the tracers showed major movement into three cellular compartments: first, to the cytoplasm of adjacent cells; secondly, from the cytoplasm, to the vacuole (irreversible); and thirdly, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (reversible). No visible accumulation in chloroplasts or mitochondria, or loss across the plasmalemma was observed. No evidence for metabolic breakdown was found in extracts from injected leaves. The time course of accumulation of the dye in the three major compartments (cytoplasm, nucleus, vacuole) was monitored using fluorescence microscopy. The rate measurements and the quantified geometry of the cells were used to generate a model of compartmentation during intercellular transport. Permeability coefficients were calculated and related to the molecular sizes of the tracers. The coefficients for the tonoplast and nuclear envelope were independent of the molecular sizes of the tracers, and were in the range 2.4$\cdot$10(-6)-4.1$\cdot$ 10(-6) cm$\cdot$s(-1) for the tonoplast, and 2.6$\cdot$10(-5)-9.4.10(-5) cm$\cdot$ s(-1) for the nuclear envelope. For intercellular movement, permeabilities were strongly dependent on molecular size, and ranged from 1.1$\cdot$10(-4) cm$\cdot$s(-1) for 6-carboxyfluorescein (376 daltons (Da)) to 9$\cdot$10(-9) cm$\cdot$s(-1) for fluorescein leucyldiglutamylleucine (874 Da). Thus, the differences in cell-to-cell movement of these tracers are based upon their differing ability to cross the intercellular walls, not upon differences in their intracellular compartmentation.},

This symplastic connectivity, while straightforward to observe using fluorescent tracers, has proven difficult to quantify. We use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, combined with a mathematical model of symplastic diffusion, to assay plasmodesmata-mediated permeability in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root meristem in wild-type and transgenic lines, and under selected chemical treatments. The permeability measured for the wild type is nearly 10-times greater than previously reported. Plamodesmal permeability remains constant in seedlings treated with auxin (30 nm indoleacetic acid for 2 and 24 h; 100 nm indoleacetic acid for 2 h); however, permeability is diminished in two lines previously reported to have impaired plasmodesmal function as well as in wild-type seedlings treated for 24 h with 0.6 mm tryptophan. Moreover, plasmodesmal permeability is strongly altered by applied hydrogen peroxide within 2 h of treatment, being approximately doubled at a low concentration (0.6 mm) and nearly eliminated at a higher one (6 mm). These results reveal that the plasmodesmata in the root meristem carry a substantial flux of small molecules and that this flux is subject to rapid regulation.},

Selective in vitro use of radiolabeled ATP analogs by \textendash{}as kinases can be exploited to identify the direct phosphorylation targets of individual kinases in complex extracts. In organisms in which it is practical to replace wild-type kinase genes with engineered alleles, the in vivo activity of a \textendash{}as kinase can be reversibly blocked with an allele-specific inhibitor. Thus, analog-sensitive kinases can be effective tools for discovery of the cellular functions and phosphorylation targets of individual enzymes.

  abstract = {Plant cells are directly connected by plasmodesmata that form channels through the cell wall and enable the intercellular movement of cytosolic solutes, membrane lipids and signalling molecules. Transport through plasmodesmata is regulated not only by a fixed size-exclusion limit, but also by physiological and pathological adaptation. To understand plant cell communication, carbon allocation and pathogen attack, the capacities for a specific molecule to pass a specific cell-wall interface is an essential parameter. So far, the degree of cell coupling was derived from frequency and diameter of plasmodesmata in relevant tissues as assessed by electron microscopy of fixed material. However, plasmodesmata functionality and capacity can only be determined in live material, not from electron microscopy, which is static and prone to fixation artefacts. Plasmodesmata functionality was a few times assessed using fluorescent tracers with diffusion properties similar to cytosolic solutes. Here, we used three-dimensional photoactivation microscopy to quantify plasmodesmata-mediated cell-wall permeability between living Cucurbita maxima leaf mesophyll cells with caged fluorescein as tracer. For the first time, all necessary functional and anatomical data were gathered for each individual cell from three-dimensional time series. This approach utilized a confocal microscope equipped with resonant scanner, which provides the high acquisition speed necessary to record optical sections of whole cells and offers time resolution high enough to follow the kinetics of photoactivation. The results were compared to two-dimensional measurements, which are shown to give a good estimate of cell coupling adequate for homogenous tissues. The two-dimensional approach is limited whenever tissues interfaces are studied that couple different cell types with diverse cell geometries.},

  abstract = {The turnover of callose ($\beta$-1,3-glucan) within cell walls is an essential process affecting many developmental, physiological and stress related processes in plants. The deposition and degradation of callose at the neck region of plasmodesmata (Pd) is one of the cellular control mechanisms regulating Pd permeability during both abiotic and biotic stresses. Callose accumulation at Pd is controlled by callose synthases (CalS; EC 2.4.1.34), endogenous enzymes mediating callose synthesis, and by $\beta$-1,3-glucanases (BG; EC 3.2.1.39), hydrolytic enzymes which specifically degrade callose. Transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of some CalSs and BGs are strongly controlled by stress signaling, such as that resulting from pathogen invasion. We review the role of Pd-associated callose in the regulation of intercellular communication during developmental, physiological, and stress response processes. Special emphasis is placed on the involvement of Pd-callose in viral pathogenicity. Callose accumulation at Pd restricts virus movement in both compatible and incompatible interactions, while its degradation promotes pathogen spread. Hence, studies on mechanisms of callose turnover at Pd during viral cell-to-cell spread are of importance for our understanding of host mechanisms exploited by viruses in order to successfully spread within the infected plant.},

  abstract = {To quantify the diffusion constant of small molecules in the plant cell wall, fluorescence from carboxyfluorescein (CF) in the intact roots of Arabidopsis thaliana was recorded. Roots were immersed in a solution of the fluorescent dye and viewed through a confocal fluorescence microscope. These roots are sufficiently transparent that much of the apoplast can be imaged. The diffusion coefficient, D(cw), of CF in the cell wall was probed using two protocols: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss following perfusion with dye-free solution. Diffusion coefficients were obtained from the kinetics of the fluorescent transients and modelling apoplast geometry. Apoplastic diffusion constants varied spatially in the root. In the elongation zone and mature cortex, D(cw)=(3.2+/-1.4)x10(-11) m(2) s(-1), whereas in mature epidermis, D(cw)=(2.5+/-0.7)x10(-12) m(2) s(-1), at least an order of magnitude lower. Relative to the diffusion coefficient of CF in water, these represent reductions by approximately 1/15 and 1/195, respectively. The low value for mature epidermis is correlated with a suberin-like permeability barrier that was detected with either autofluorescence or berberine staining. This study provides a quantitative estimate of the permeability of plant cell walls to small organic acids-a class of compounds that includes auxin and other plant hormones. These measurements constrain models of solute transport, and are important for quantitative models of hormone signalling during plant growth and development.},

This explains the isotopic enrichment of leaf water from the xylem to the mesophyll, and we showed how it relates to earlier models of leaf water enrichment in non-steady state. The effective length or tortuosity factor of isotopologue movement in leaves is unknown and, therefore, is a fitted parameter in the model. We compared the advection\textendash{}diffusion model to previously published data sets for Lupinus angustifolius and Eucalyptus globulus. Night-time stomatal conductance was not measured in either data set and is therefore another fitted parameter. The model compared very well with the observations of bulk mesophyll water during the whole diel cycle. It compared well with the enrichment at the evaporative sites during the day but showed some deviations at night for E. globulus. It became clear from our analysis that night-time stomatal conductance should be measured in the future and that the temperature dependence of the tracer diffusivities should be accounted for. However, varying mesophyll water volume did not seem critical for obtaining a good prediction of leaf water enrichment, at least in our data sets. In addition, observations of single diurnal cycles do not seem to constrain the effective length that relates to the tortuosity of the water path in the mesophyll. Finally, we showed when simpler models of leaf water enrichment were suitable for applications of leaf water isotopes once weighted with the appropriate gas exchange flux. We showed that taking an unsuitable leaf water enrichment model could lead to large biases when cumulated over only 1 day.},

Outlook 66 Acknowledgements 66 References 66 Summary Plasmodesmata (PD) are plasma membrane-lined pores that connect neighbouring plant cells, bridging the cell wall and establishing cytoplasmic and membrane continuity between cells. PD are dynamic structures regulated by callose deposition in a variety of stress and developmental contexts. This process crudely controls the aperture of the pore and thus the flux of molecules between cells. During pathogen infection, plant cells initiate a range of immune responses and it was recently identified that, following perception of fungal and bacterial pathogens, plant cells initially close their PD. Systemic defence responses depend on the spread of signals between cells, raising questions about whether PD are in different functional states during different immune responses. It is well established that viral pathogens exploit PD to spread between cells, but it has more recently been identified that protein effectors secreted by fungal pathogens can spread between host cells via PD. It is possible that many classes of pathogens specifically target PD to aid infection, which would infer antagonistic regulation of PD by host and pathogen. How PD regulation benefits both host immune responses and pathogen infection is an important question and demands that we examine the multicellular nature of plant\textendash{}pathogen interactions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: (1,3)-$\beta$-Glucan callose is a cell wall polymer that is involved in several fundamental biological processes, ranging from plant development to the response to abiotic and biotic stresses. Despite its importance in maintaining plant integrity and plant defence, knowledge about the regulation of callose biosynthesis at its diverse sites of action within the plant is still limited. The moderately sized family of GSL (GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE) genes is predicted to encode callose synthases with a specific biological function and subcellular localization. Phosphorylation and directed translocation of callose synthases seem to be key post-translational mechanisms of enzymatic regulation, whereas transcriptional control of GSL genes might only have a minor function in response to biotic or abiotic stresses. SCOPE AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the different sites of callose biosynthesis within the plant, particular attention has been focused on the formation of callose in response to pathogen attack. Here, callose is deposited between the plasma membrane and the cell wall to act as a physical barrier to stop or slow invading pathogens. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is one of the best-studied models not only for general plant defence responses but also for the regulation of pathogen-induced callose biosynthesis. Callose synthase GSL5 (GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE5) has been shown to be responsible for stress-induced callose deposition. Within the last decade of research into stress-induced callose, growing evidence has been found that the timing of callose deposition in the multilayered system of plant defence responses could be the key parameter for optimal effectiveness. This timing seems to be achieved through co-ordinated transport and formation of the callose synthase complex.},

  abstract = {Callose deposition in Arabidopsis has emerged as a popular model system to quantify activity of plant immunity. However, there has been a noticeable rise in contradicting reports about the regulation of pathogen-induced callose. To address this controversy, we have examined the robustness of callose deposition under different growth conditions and in response to two different pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the flagellin epitope Flg22 and the polysaccharide chitosan. Based on a commonly used hydroponic culture system, we found that variations in growth conditions have a major impact on the plant's overall capacity to deposit callose. This environmental variability correlated with levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Depending on the growth conditions, pretreatment with abscissic acid stimulated or repressed callose deposition. Despite a similar effect of growth conditions on Flg22- and chitosan-induced callose, both responses showed differences in timing, tissue responsiveness, and colocalization with H2O2. Furthermore, mutant analysis revealed that Flg22- and chitosan-induced callose differ in the requirement for the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, the glucosinolate regulatory enzymes VTC1 and PEN2, and the callose synthase PMR4. Our study demonstrates that callose is a multifaceted defense response that is controlled by distinct signaling pathways, depending on the environmental conditions and the challenging pathogen-associated molecular pattern.},

The fungus then moves to adjacent cells via plasmodesmata, the plant's intercellular channels. Sakulkoo et al. used a chemical genetic approach to selectively inhibit a single MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase, Pmk1, in the blast fungus. Inhibition of Pmk1 trapped the fungus within a rice cell. Pmk1 regulated the expression of a suite of effector genes involved in suppression of host immunity, allowing the fungus to manipulate plasmodesmal conductance. At the same time, Pmk1 regulated the fungus's hyphal constriction, which allows movement into new host cells. Science, this issue p. 1399 Blast disease destroys up to 30\% of the rice crop annually and threatens global food security. The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae invades plant tissue with hyphae that proliferate and grow from cell to cell, often through pit fields, where plasmodesmata cluster. We showed that chemical genetic inhibition of a single fungal mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, Pmk1, prevents M. oryzae from infecting adjacent plant cells, leaving the fungus trapped within a single plant cell. Pmk1 regulates expression of secreted fungal effector proteins implicated in suppression of host immune defenses, preventing reactive oxygen species generation and excessive callose deposition at plasmodesmata. Furthermore, Pmk1 controls the hyphal constriction required for fungal growth from one rice cell to the neighboring cell, enabling host tissue colonization and blast disease. A fungal MAP kinase controls hyphal diameters and callose deposition patterns as the fungus grows through intercellular channels.

The most recent paradigm to gain wide acceptance in the field is often referred to as the zigzag model, which reconciles the previously formulated gene-for-gene hypothesis with the recognition of general elicitors in a single model. This review focuses on the limitations of the current paradigm of molecular plant-microbe interactions and how it too narrowly defines the plant immune system. As such, we discuss an alternative view of plant innate immunity as a system that evolves to detect invasion. This view accommodates the range from mutualistic to parasitic symbioses that plants form with diverse organisms, as well as the spectrum of ligands that the plant immune system perceives. Finally, how this view can contribute to the current practice of resistance breeding is discussed.},

Plasmodesmata bridge the rigid physical barrier presented by the cell wall to extend the symplasm from single cells to tissue domains that have functional importance for tissue growth, development, and defense. Although recent years have seen advances in our knowledge of the physical nature of PD, the trafficked molecules, and of the wider processes they affect, our knowledge of PD structure and function is still relatively rudimentary.

  abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) is a critical hormonal regulator of plant growth and defense. To advance our understanding of the architecture and dynamic regulation of the JA gene regulatory network, we performed a high-resolution RNA-seq time series of methyl JA-treated Arabidopsis thaliana at 15 time points over a 16-h period. Computational analysis showed that methyl JA (MeJA) induces a burst of transcriptional activity, generating diverse expression patterns over time that partition into distinct sectors of the JA response targeting specific biological processes. The presence of transcription factor (TF) DNA binding motifs correlated with specific TF activity during temporal MeJA-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Insight into the underlying dynamic transcriptional regulation mechanisms was captured in a chronological model of the JA gene regulatory network. Several TFs, including MYB59 and bHLH27, were uncovered as early network components with a role in pathogen and insect resistance. Analysis of subnetworks surrounding the TFs ORA47, RAP2.6L, MYB59, and ANAC055, using transcriptome profiling of overexpressors and mutants, provided insights into their regulatory role in defined modules of the JA network. Collectively, our work illuminates the complexity of the JA gene regulatory network, pinpoints and validates previously unknown regulators, and provides a valuable resource for functional studies on JA signaling components in plant defense and development.},

  abstract = {Plants use different immune pathways to combat pathogens. The activation of the jasmonic acid (JA)-signaling pathway is required for resistance against necrotrophic pathogens; however, to combat biotrophic pathogens, the plants activate mainly the salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathway. SA can antagonize JA signaling and vice versa. NPR1 (noninducible pathogenesis-related 1) is considered a master regulator of SA signaling. NPR1 interacts with TGA transcription factors, ultimately leading to the activation of SA-dependent responses. SA has been shown to promote disease development caused by the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea through NPR1, by suppressing the expression of two JA-dependent defense genes, proteinase inhibitors I and II. We show here that the transcription factor TGA1.a contributes to disease development caused by B. cinerea in tomato by suppressing the expression of proteinase inhibitors I and II. Finally, we present evidence that the SA-signaling pathway contributes to disease development caused by another necrotrophic pathogen, Alternaria solani, in tomato. Disease development promoted by SA through NPR1 requires the TGA1.a transcription factor. These data highlight how necrotrophs manipulate the SAsignaling pathway to promote their disease in tomato.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a central process in plant immunity. The induction or repression of defense genes is orchestrated by signaling networks that are directed by plant hormones of which salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are the major players. Extensive cross-communication between the hormone signaling pathways allows for fine tuning of transcriptional programs, determining resistance to invaders and trade-offs with plant development. Here, we give an overview of how SA can control transcriptional reprogramming of JA-induced genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. SA can influence activity and/or localization of transcriptional regulators by post-translational modifications of transcription factors and co-regulators. SA-induced redox changes, mediated by thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, modify transcriptional regulators that are involved in suppression of JA-dependent genes, such as NPR1 and TGA transcription factors, which affects their localization or DNA binding activity. Furthermore, SA can mediate sequestering of JA-responsive transcription factors away from their target genes by stalling them in the cytosol or in complexes with repressor proteins in the nucleus. SA also affects JA-induced transcription by inducing degradation of transcription factors with an activating role in JA signaling, as was shown for the ERF transcription factor ORA59. Additionally, SA can induce negative regulators, among which WRKY transcription factors, that can directly or indirectly inhibit JA-responsive gene expression. Finally, at the DNA level, modification of histones by SA-dependent factors can result in repression of JA-responsive genes. These diverse and complex regulatory mechanisms affect important signaling hubs in the integration of hormone signaling networks. Some pathogens have evolved effectors that highjack hormone crosstalk mechanisms for their own good, which are described in this review as well.},

We define a tempera- ture-sensitive period and link heat tolerance to chromo- some 5D. Abstract This study assesses the effects of heat on meiotic progression and grain number in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Chinese Spring), defines a heat-sensitive stage and evaluates the role of chromosome 5D in heat tol- erance. Plants were exposed to high temperatures (30 or 35 $^\circ$C) in a controlled environment room for 20-h periods during meiosis and the premeiotic interphase just prior to meiosis. Examination of pollen mother cells (PMCs) from immature anthers immediately before and after heat treat- ment enabled precise identification of the developmen- tal phases being exposed to heat. A temperature-sensitive period was defined, lasting from premeiotic interphase to late leptotene, during which heat can prevent PMCs from progressing through meiosis. PMCs exposed to 35 $^\circ$C were less likely to progress than those exposed to 30 $^\circ$C. Grain number per spike was reduced at 30 $^\circ$C, and reduced even further at 35 $^\circ$C. Chinese Spring nullisomic 5D-tetrasomic 5B (N5DT5B) plants, which lack chromosome 5D, were more susceptible to heat during premeiosis\textendash{}leptotene than Chinese Spring plants with the normal (euploid) chromo- some complement. The proportion of plants with PMCs progressing through meiosis after heat treatment was lower for N5DT5B plants than for euploids, but the difference was not significant. However, following exposure to 30 $^\circ$C, in euploid plants grain number was reduced (though not significantly), whereas in N5DT5B plants the reduction was highly significant. After exposure to 35 $^\circ$C, the reduc- tion in grain number was highly significant for both gen- otypes. Implications of these findings for the breeding of thermotolerant wheat are discussed.},

A double Gaussian fitted simultaneously to grain number and weight data from two contrasting elite lines (Renesansa, listed in Serbia, Ppd-D1a, Rht8; Savannah, listed in UK, Ppd-D1b, Rht-D1b) identified peak periods of main stem susceptibility centred on 3 (s.e.= 0.82) and 18 (s.e. = 0.55) days (mean daily temperature = 14.3oC) pre-GS 65 for both cultivars. Severity of effect depended on genotype, growth stage and their interaction: grain set relative to that achieved at 20/15oC dropped below 80\% for Savannah at booting and Renesansa at anthesis. Savannah was relatively tolerant to heat stress at anthesis. A further experiment including 62 lines of the mapping, doubled-haploid progeny of Renesansa x Savannah found tolerance at anthesis to be associated with Ppd-D1b, Rht-D1b, and a QTL from Renesansa on chromosome 2A. None of the relevant markers were associated with tolerance during booting. Rht8 was never associated with heat stress tolerance, a lack of effect confirmed in a further experiment where Rht8 was included in a comparison of near isogenic lines in a cv. Paragon background. Some compensatory increases in mean grain weight were observed, but only when stress was applied during booting and only where Ppd-D1a was absent.},

  abstract = {As the result of intensive research and breeding efforts over the last 20 years, the yield potential and yield quality of cereals have been greatly improved. Nowadays, yield safety has gained more importance because of the forecasted climatic changes. Drought and high temperature are especially considered as key stress factors with high potential impact on crop yield. Yield safety can only be improved if future breeding attempts will be based on the valuable new knowledge acquired on the processes determining plant development and its responses to stress. Plant stress responses are very complex. Interactions between plant structure, function and the environment need to be investigated at various phases of plant development at the organismal, cellular as well as molecular levels in order to obtain a full picture. The results achieved so far in this field indicate that various plant organs, in a definite hierarchy and in interaction with each other, are involved in determining crop yield under stress. Here we attempt to summarize the currently available information on cereal reproduction under drought and heat stress and to give an outlook towards potential strategies to improve yield safety in cereals.},

While useful measurements can be obtained by segmenting a whole plant from the background, they suggest that the increased range and precision of measurements made available by leaf-level segmentation makes this a problem well worth solving. A variety of approaches have been tried by biologists as well as computer vision researchers. This is an interdisciplinary area and the computer vision community has an important contribution to make. They suggest that there is a need for publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations to enable the evaluation of new approaches and to support the building of training data for modern data-driven computer vision approaches, which are those most likely to result in the kind of fully automated systems that will be of use to biologists.},

  abstract = {Computed tomography remains strongly underused in plant sciences despite its high potential in delivering detailed 3D phenotypical information because of the low X-ray absorption of most plant tissues. Existing protocols to study soft tissues display poor performance, especially when compared to those used on animals. More efficient protocols to study plant material are therefore needed. Flowers of Arabidopsis thaliana and Marcgravia caudata were immersed in a selection of contrasting agents used to treat samples for transmission electron microscopy. Grayscale values for floral tissues and background were measured as a function of time. Contrast was quantified via a contrast index. The thick buds of Marcgravia were scanned to determine which contrasting agents best penetrate thick tissues. The highest contrast increase with cytoplasm-rich tissues was obtained with phosphotungstate, whereas osmium tetroxide and bismuth tatrate displayed the highest contrast increase with vacuolated tissues. Phosphotungstate also displayed the best sample penetration. Furthermore, infiltration with phosphotungstate allowed imaging of all plants parts at a high resolution of 3 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, which approaches the maximum resolution of our equipment: 1.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m. The high affinity of phosphotungstate for vasculature, cytoplasm-rich tissue, and pollen causes these tissues to absorb more X-rays than the surrounding tissues, which, in turn, makes these tissues appear brighter on the scan data. Tissues with different brightness can then be virtually dissected from each other by selecting the bracket of grayscale to be visualized. Promising directions for the future include in silico phenotyping and developmental studies of plant inner parts (e.g., ovules, vasculature, pollen, and cell nuclei) via virtual dissection as well as correlations of quantitative phenotypes with omics datasets. Therefore, this work represents a crucial improvement of previous methods, allowing new directions of research to be undertaken in areas ranging from morphology to systems biology.},

  abstract = {The wheat group has evolved through allopolyploidization, namely, through hybridization among species from the plant genera Aegilops and Triticum followed by genome doubling. This speciation process has been associated with ecogeographical expansion and with domestication. In the past few decades, we have searched for explanations for this impressive success. Our studies attempted to probe the bases for the wide genetic variation characterizing these species, which accounts for their great adaptability and colonizing ability. Central to our work was the investigation of how allopolyploidization alters genome structure and expression. We found in wheat that allopolyploidy accelerated genome evolution in two ways: (1) it triggered rapid genome alterations through the instantaneous generation of a variety of cardinal genetic and epigenetic changes (which we termed "revolutionary" changes), and (2) it facilitated sporadic genomic changes throughout the species' evolution (i.e., evolutionary changes), which are not attainable at the diploid level. Our major findings in natural and synthetic allopolyploid wheat indicate that these alterations have led to the cytological and genetic diploidization of the allopolyploids. These genetic and epigenetic changes reflect the dynamic structural and functional plasticity of the allopolyploid wheat genome. The significance of this plasticity for the successful establishment of wheat allopolyploids, in nature and under domestication, is discussed.},

  abstract = {Food legume crops play important roles in conservation farming systems and contribute to food security in the developing world. However, in many regions of the world, their production has been adversely affected by drought. Although water scarcity is a severe abiotic constraint of legume crops productivity, it remains unclear how the effects of drought co-vary with legume species, soil texture, agroclimatic region, and drought timing. To address these uncertainties, we collected literature data between 1980 and 2014 that reported monoculture legume yield responses to drought under field conditions, and analyzed this data set using meta-analysis techniques. Our results showed that the amount of water reduction was positively related with yield reduction, but the extent of the impact varied with legume species and the phenological state during which drought occurred. Overall, lentil (Lens culinaris), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) were found to experience lower drought-induced yield reduction compared to legumes such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and green gram (Vigna radiate). Yield reduction was generally greater when legumes experienced drought during their reproductive stage compared to during their vegetative stage. Legumes grown in soil with medium texture also exhibited greater yield reduction compared to those planted on soil of either coarse or fine texture. In contrast, regions and their associated climatic factors did not significantly affect legume yield reduction. In the face of changing climate, our study provides useful information for agricultural planning and research directions for development of drought-resistant legume species to improve adaptation and resilience of agricultural systems in the drought-prone regions of the world.},

Recent findings in the field suggest that defense signaling pathways are tightly linked to the regulation of PD, and the restriction of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication is an essential innate immune response to microbial pathogens. Moreover, several plasma membrane-bound signaling components, including receptor-like kinases that are known to have non-cell autonomous function or pathogen perception at the cell periphery, are found to also partition to PD. These findings hint at the novel role of PD as a signaling hub for both symplasmic and cross-membrane pathways.},

  abstract = {Root system interactions and competition for resources are active areas of research that contribute to our understanding of how roots perceive and react to environmental conditions. Recent research has shown this complex suite of processes can now be observed in a natural environment (i.e. soil) through the use of X-ray microcomputed tomography (CT), which allows non-destructive analysis of plant root systems. Due to their similar X-ray attenuation coefficients and densities, the roots of different plants appear as similar greyscale intensity values in CT image data. Unless they are manually and carefully traced, it has not previously been possible to automatically label and separate different root systems grown in the same soil environment. We present a technique, based on a visual tracking approach, which exploits knowledge of the shape of root cross-sections to automatically recover from X-ray CT data three-dimensional descriptions of multiple, interacting root architectures growing in soil. The method was evaluated on both simulated root data and real images of two interacting winter wheat Cordiale (Triticumaestivum L.) plants grown in a single soil column, demonstrating that it is possible to automatically segment different root systems from within the same soil sample. This work supports the automatic exploration of supportive and competitive foraging behaviour of plant root systems in natural soil environments. Significance Statement Imaging roots in their natural soil environment is important for understanding their growth, development and resource competition. Here we describe how interacting root systems can be separated and visualised using X-ray micro Computed Tomography images.

  abstract = {Wheat is fundamental to human civilization and has played an outstanding role in feeding a hungry world and improving global food security. The crop contributes about 20 \% of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 \% annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 \% of the total harvested area and 50 \% of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 \% of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR ``spared'' essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future.},

Eight published time series of species abun- dances were used in the analysis, including data sets for: fishes, birds, mammals, stream benthos, and crabs. To test the efficacy of eigenvalue tests, we constructed 1000 randomly generated data sets for each real data set, whose means and variances were identical to the means and variances of the original data matrices. The data sets were then subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA) and eigenvalue tests used to identify significant ei- genvalues for both correlation and covariance matrix solutions. We also examined the effects of: (1) number of species (= number of variables), (2) number of samples (= rep- lication), and (3) variance structure, on the performance of the test. Using PCA's based on the correlation matrix and with sample sizes typically encountered in the field, the eigenvalue tests generally performed at the .05 level when a = .01. Slightly poorer results were obtained with the covariance matrix. Increasing the number of samples to at least three times the number of species generally gave a level coverage for an a level test (i.e., a = .05, .01). Increasing variance in the data set only affected test outcomes at levels of replication less than twice the number of species. We conclude that the eigenvalue tests can be used to detect patterns in PCA's of assemblage structure data, if the number of samples is at least three times the number of species and either a covariance or correlation matrix solution is used. It is assumed that these patterns represent ecologically meaningful patterns of variation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Phenotyping is a critical component of plant research. Accurate and precise trait collection, when integrated with genetic tools, can greatly accelerate the rate of genetic gain in crop improvement. However, efficient and automatic phenotyping of traits across large populations is a challenge; which is further exacerbated by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials. A promising approach is to leverage current advances in imaging technology, data analytics and machine learning to enable automated and fast phenotyping and subsequent decision support. In this context, the workflow for phenotyping (image capture $\rightarrow$ data storage and curation $\rightarrow$ trait extraction $\rightarrow$ machine learning/classification $\rightarrow$ models/apps for decision support) has to be carefully designed and efficiently executed to minimize resource usage and maximize utility. We illustrate such an end-to-end phenotyping workflow for the case of plant stress severity phenotyping in soybean, with a specific focus on the rapid and automatic assessment of iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) severity on thousands of field plots. We showcase this analytics framework by extracting IDC features from a set of $\sim$4500 unique canopies representing a diverse germplasm base that have different levels of IDC, and subsequently training a variety of classification models to predict plant stress severity. The best classifier is then deployed as a smartphone app for rapid and real time severity rating in the field. RESULTS We investigated 10 different classification approaches, with the best classifier being a hierarchical classifier with a mean per-class accuracy of $\sim$96\%. We construct a phenotypically meaningful 'population canopy graph', connecting the automatically extracted canopy trait features with plant stress severity rating. We incorporated this image capture $\rightarrow$ image processing $\rightarrow$ classification workflow into a smartphone app that enables automated real-time evaluation of IDC scores using digital images of the canopy. CONCLUSION We expect this high-throughput framework to help increase the rate of genetic gain by providing a robust extendable framework for other abiotic and biotic stresses. We further envision this workflow embedded onto a high throughput phenotyping ground vehicle and unmanned aerial system that will allow real-time, automated stress trait detection and quantification for plant research, breeding and stress scouting applications.},

  abstract = {Roots are vital to plants for soil exploration and uptake of water and nutrients. Root performance is critical for growth and yield of plants, in particular when resources are limited. Since roots develop in strong interaction with the soil matrix, tools are required that can visualize and quantify root growth in opaque soil at best in 3D. Two modalities that are suited for such investigations are X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Due to the different physical principles they are based on, these modalities have their specific potentials and challenges for root phenotyping. We compared the two methods by imaging the same root systems grown in 3 different pot sizes with inner diameters of 34 mm, 56 mm or 81 mm. Both methods successfully visualized roots of two weeks old bean plants in all three pot sizes. Similar root images and almost the same root length were obtained for roots grown in the small pot, while more root details showed up in the CT images compared to MRI. For the medium sized pot, MRI showed more roots and higher root lengths whereas at some spots thin roots were only found by CT and the high water content apparently affected CT more than MRI. For the large pot, MRI detected much more roots including some laterals than CT. Both techniques performed equally well for pots with small diameters which are best suited to monitor root development of seedlings. To investigate specific root details or finely graduated root diameters of thin roots, CT was advantageous as it provided the higher spatial resolution. For larger pot diameters, MRI delivered higher fractions of the root systems than CT, most likely because of the strong root-to-soil contrast achievable by MRI. Since complementary information can be gathered with CT and MRI, a combination of the two modalities could open a whole range of additional possibilities like analysis of root system traits in different soil structures or under varying soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Western agriculture and its most important crop plants are thought to have originated about 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, a geographical region extending from modern-day Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and western Syria into southeastern Turkey and along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers into Iraq and Iran (Smith 1995 ; Bar-Yosef 1998 ; Diamond 1998 ; Moore, Hillman, and Legge 2000 ; Zohary and Hopf 2000 ; Gopher, Abbo, and Lev-Yadun 2002 ). Two traditional lines of evidence support that view. First, the geographical distributions of wild progenitors of modern cereal species, among them wild wheats (Triticum urartu, T. boeoticum, T. dicoccoides, Aegilops tauschii), wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum), and wild rye (S. vavilovii), intersect in this region (Nesbitt and Samuel 1996 ; Moore, Hillman, and Legge 2000 ; Zohary and Hopf 2000 ; Gopher, Abbo, and Lev-Yadun 2002 ). Second, seeds of the wild species occur in early archaeological sites of the region, followed in radiocarbon age and stratigraphic succession by the remains of domesticated forms (Moore, Hillman, and Legge 2000 ; Zohary and Hopf 2000 ; Gopher, Abbo, and Lev-Yadun 2002 ). Recently, molecular evolutionary studies have also begun to weigh heavily on this issue. Genetic identification of the natural stands from which wild crops were domesticated addresses the question of where specifically within the Fertile Crescent humans invented agriculture. The approach involves comparing wild and domesticated populations using molecular markers, which give genome-wide estimates of genetic similarity (Heun et al. 1997 ; Badr et al. 2000 ; Martin and Salamini 2000 ). One of the most promising of these techniques is amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedure that resolves radioactively labeled electrophoretic bands (polymorphic loci) on sequencing gels.},

  abstract = {The quantification of floral shape variations is difficult because flower structures are both diverse and complex. Traditionally, floral shape variations are quantified using the qualitative and linear measurements of two-dimensional (2D) images. The 2D images cannot adequately describe flower structures, and thus lead to unsatisfactory discrimination of the flower shape. This study aimed to acquire three-dimensional (3D) images by using microcomputed tomography ($\mu$CT) and to examine the floral shape variations by using geometric morphometrics (GM). To demonstrate the advantages of the 3D-$\mu$CT-GM approach, we applied the approach to a second-generation population of florist's gloxinia (Sinningia speciosa) crossed from parents of zygomorphic and actinomorphic flowers. The flowers in the population considerably vary in size and shape, thereby served as good materials to test the applicability of the proposed phenotyping approach. Procedures were developed to acquire 3D volumetric flower images using a $\mu$CT scanner, to segment the flower regions from the background, and to select homologous characteristic points (i.e., landmarks) from the flower images for the subsequent GM analysis. The procedures identified 95 landmarks for each flower and thus improved the capability of describing and illustrating the flower shapes, compared with typically lower number of landmarks in 2D analyses. The GM analysis demonstrated that flower opening and dorsoventral symmetry were the principal shape variations of the flowers. The degrees of flower opening and corolla asymmetry were then subsequently quantified directly from the 3D flower images. The 3D-$\mu$CT-GM approach revealed shape variations that could not be identified using typical 2D approaches and accurately quantified the flower traits that presented a challenge in 2D images. The approach opens new avenues to investigate floral shape variations.},

Cultivation of wild cereals such as Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) and Triticum diccocoides (wild emmer) started in southwest Asia. Despite the many studies on the origins of agriculture and plant domestication, surprisingly few studies have discussed the importance of the nutritional quality of barley and emmer wheat in their evolution. A comparison of domesticated forms of these cereals with their wild progenitors suggests an evolution towards bigger grains with higher glycemic loads in the form of higher relative starch content with lower relative protein, fiber and mineral contents. In this work we hypothesize that in addition to the simple explanation that larger grains emerged under domestication, complex and indirect effects such as increased glycemic index and sweet taste should also be taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {Further improvements to wheat yield potential will be essential to meet future food demand. As yield is related to the number of fertile florets and grains, an understanding of the basis of their generation is instrumental to raising yield. Based on (i) a strong positive association between the number of fertile florets or grains and spike dry weight at anthesis; and (ii) the finding that floret death occurs when spikes grow at maximum rate, it was always assumed that floret survival depends on the growth of the spike. However, this assumption was recently questioned, suggesting that assimilates diverted to the spike do not determine the number of florets and grains and that the onset of floret death may instead be a developmental process that is not associated with spike growth. In this study, the relationships between the fate of floret primordia and spike growth from six independent experiments that included different growing conditions (greenhouse/field experiments, growing seasons, photoperiod/shading treatments during the floret primordia phase) and diverse cultivar types (winter/spring, semi-dwarf/standard-height, photoperiod sensitive/insensitive) were re-analysed together. Onset of floret death was associated with the beginning of spike growth at the maximum rate in c. 80\% of the cases analysed; and the rate of floret death (the main determinant of floret survival) showed a negative quantitative relationship with spike weight at anthesis. As floret death and survival were shown to be linked to pre-anthesis spike growth, the strategy of focusing on traits associated with pre-anthesis spike growth when breeding to increase wheat yield potential further is valuable.},

Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are transferred, especially from hosts to pathogens/pests, is still unknown. Here we show that host Arabidopsis cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. Transferred host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, Arabidopsis has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen.},

Tin2 masks a ubiquitin\textendash{}proteasome degradation motif in ZmTTK1, thus stabilizing the active kinase. Active ZmTTK1 controls activation of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Without Tin2, enhanced lignin biosynthesis is observed in infected tissue and vascular bundles show strong lignification. This is presumably limiting access of fungal hyphae to nutrients needed for massive proliferation. Consistent with this assertion, we observe that maize brown midrib mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis are hypersensitive to U. maydis infection. We speculate that Tin2 rewires metabolites into the anthocyanin pathway to lower their availability for other defense responses.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether the unique physical milieu just beneath the cell plasma membrane influences the rheology of fluid-phase cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic viscosity was evaluated from the picosecond rotation of the small fluorophore 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) by parallel-acquisition Fourier transform microfluorimetry (Fushimi and Verkman, 1991). Information about viscosity within $<$ 200 nm of cell plasma membranes was obtained by selective excitation of fluorophores in an evanescent field created by total internal reflection (TIR) of impulse-modulated s-plane-polarized laser illumination (488 nm) at a glass-aqueous interface. Measurements of fluorescence lifetime and time-resolved anisotropy were carried out in solutions containing fluorescein or BCECF at known viscosities, and monolayers of BCECF-labeled Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Specific concerns associated with time-resolved fluorescence measurements in the evanescent field were examined theoretically and/or experimentally, including variations in lifetime due to fluorophore proximity to the interface, and the use of the s and p polarized excitation. In fluorescein solutions excited with s-plane polarized light, there was a 5-10\% decrease in fluorescein lifetime with TIR compared to trans (subcritical) illumination, but no change in rotational correlation time (approximately 98 ps/cP). Intracellular BCECF had a single lifetime of 3.7 +/- 0.1 ns near the cell plasma membrane. Apparent fluid-phase viscosity near the cell plasma membrane was 1.1 +/- 0.2 cP (fibroblast) and 1.0 +/- 0.2 cP (MDCK), not significantly different from the viscosity measured in bulk cytoplasm far from the plasma membrane. The results establish the methodology for time-resolved microfluorimetric measurement of polarization in the evanescent field and demonstrate that the cell plasma membrane has little effect on the fluid-phase viscosity of adjacent cytoplasm.},

This work provides insight into how the defense hormone salicylic acid and its signaling pathway regulate intercellular bridges called plasmodesmata., In plants, mounting an effective innate immune strategy against microbial pathogens involves triggering local cell death within infected cells as well as boosting the immunity of the uninfected neighboring and systemically located cells. Although not much is known about this, it is evident that well-coordinated cell\textendash{}cell signaling is critical in this process to confine infection to local tissue while allowing for the spread of systemic immune signals throughout the whole plant. In support of this notion, direct cell-to-cell communication was recently found to play a crucial role in plant defense. Here, we provide experimental evidence that salicylic acid () is a critical hormonal signal that regulates cell-to-cell permeability during innate immune responses elicited by virulent bacterial infection in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that direct exogenous application of  or bacterial infection suppresses cell\textendash{}cell coupling and that  pathway mutants are impaired in this response. The - or infection-induced suppression of cell\textendash{}cell coupling requires an ENHANCED DESEASE RESISTANCE1\textendash{} and NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1\textendash{}dependent  pathway in conjunction with the regulator of plasmodesmal gating PLASMODESMATA-LOCATED PROTEIN5.

  abstract = {Chitin acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern from fungal pathogens whose perception triggers a range of defense responses. We show that LYSIN MOTIF DOMAIN-CONTAINING GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-ANCHORED PROTEIN 2 (LYM2), the Arabidopsis homolog of a rice chitin receptor-like protein, mediates a reduction in molecular flux via plasmodesmata in the presence of chitin. For this response, lym2-1 mutants are insensitive to the presence of chitin, but not to the flagellin derivative flg22. Surprisingly, the chitin-recognition receptor CHITIN ELCITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) is not required for chitin-induced changes to plasmodesmata flux, suggesting that there are at least two chitin-activated response pathways in Arabidopsis and that LYM2 is not required for CERK1-mediated chitin-triggered defense responses, indicating that these pathways are independent. In accordance with a role in the regulation of intercellular flux, LYM2 is resident at the plasma membrane and is enriched at plasmodesmata. Chitin-triggered regulation of molecular flux between cells is required for defense responses against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, and thus we conclude that the regulation of symplastic continuity and molecular flux between cells is a vital component of chitin-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis.},

Cellular mRNA transcripts, endogenous small RNAs and defense-related small RNAs all move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata (PD), and may even move long distances in the phloem. Despite their small size, PD have complicated substructures, and the area of the pore available for RNA trafficking can be remarkably small. The intent of this review is to bring into focus the role of PD in cell-to-cell and long distance communication in plants. We consider how cellular RNAs could move through the cell to the PD and thence through PD. The protein composition of PD and the possible roles of PD proteins in RNA trafficking are also discussed. Recent evidence for RNA metabolism in organelles acting as a factor in controlling PD flux is also presented, highlighting new aspects of plant intra- and intercellular communication. It is clear that while the phenomenon of RNA mobility is common and essential, many questions remain, and these have been highlighted throughout this review.},

This communication has to be tightly regulated to ensure that cellular components such as organelles, macromolecules, hormones, or viruses leave the cell in a precisely organized way. During evolution, plants, animals, and fungi have developed similar ways of responding to this biological challenge. For example, in higher plants, plasmodesmata connect adjacent cells and allow communication to regulate differentiation and development. In animals, two main general structures that enable short- and long-range intercellular communication are known, namely gap junctions and tunneling nanotubes, respectively. Finally, filamentous fungi have also developed specialized structures called septal pores that allow intercellular communication via cytoplasmic flow. This review summarizes the underlying mechanisms for intercellular communication in these three eukaryotic groups and discusses its consequences for the regulation of differentiation and developmental processes.},

  abstract = {In plants, plasmodesmata (PD) serve as channels for micromolecular and macromolecular cell-to-cell transport. Based on structure, PD in immature tissues are classified into two types, simple and branched (X- and Y-shaped) or twinned. The maximum size of molecules capable of PD transport defines PD aperture, known as the PD size exclusion limit. Here we report an Arabidopsis mutation, decreased size exclusion limit1 (dse1), that exhibits reduced cell-to-cell transport of the small (524 Da) fluorescent tracer 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid at the midtorpedo stage of embryogenesis. Correspondingly, the fraction of X- and Y-shaped and twinned PD was reduced in dse1 embryos compared with WT embryos at this stage, suggesting that the frequency of PD is related to transport capability. dse1 is caused by a point mutation in At4g29860 (previously termed TANMEI) at the last donor splice site of its transcript, resulting in alternative splicing in both the first intron and the last intron. AtDSE1 is a conserved eukaryotic 386-aa WD-repeat protein critical for Arabidopsis morphogenesis and reproduction. Similar to its homologs in mouse, null mutants are embryo-lethal. The weak loss-of-function mutant dse1 exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes, including retarded vegetative growth, delayed flowering time, dysfunctional male and female organs, and delayed senescence. Finally, silencing of DSE1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves leads to reduced movement of GFP fused to tobacco mosaic virus movement protein. Thus, DSE1 is important for regulating PD transport between plant cells.},

In order to determine the possible structural and functional effects of callose, its deposition was inhibited through incubation of the plant tissue with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DDG) for 1 h prior to fixation in 2.5\% glutaraldehyde. The inhibition of callose formation was monitored through aniline blue-induced fluorescence of callose. The neck region of the plasmodesmata fromAllium cepa L. roots treated with DDG exhibited a funnel-shaped configuration. This is in contrast to the plasmodesmata from tissue not incubated with DDG, which exhibited constricted necks similar to those previously reported. Both initial dissection and glutaraldehyde fixation induced neck constriction in plasmodesmata, however, dissection of tissue increased the frequency of constrictions. The inhibition of callose formation by chemical means showed that the neck constrictions and raised collars in this area are artefacts due to physical wounding and glutaraldehyde fixation. The external electron-dense material observed when tannic acid is included in the primary fixative appears to be unrelated to the deposition of callose at the neck region.},

Approximately one-third of the Arabidopsis genome is differentially expressed during the first 48 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring before significant lesion development. We used computational tools to obtain a detailed chronology of the defense response against B. cinerea, highlighting the times at which signaling and metabolic processes change, and identify transcription factor families operating at different times after infection. Motif enrichment and network inference predicted regulatory interactions, and testing of one such prediction identified a role for TGA3 in defense against necrotrophic pathogens.

  abstract = {Positional information is crucial for the determination of plant cell fates, and it is established based on coordinated cell-to-cell communication, which in turn is essential for plant growth and development. Plants have evolved a unique communication pathway, with tiny channels called plasmodesmata (PD) spanning the cell wall. PD interconnect most cells in the plant and generate a cytoplasmic continuum, to mediate short- and long-distance trafficking of various molecules. Cell-to-cell communication through PD plays a role in transmitting positional signals, however, the regulatory mechanisms of PD-mediated trafficking are still largely unknown. The induction and maintenance of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) depends on PDmediated cell-to-cell communication, hence, it is an optimal model for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication and its function in specifying cell fates. In this review, we summarize recent knowledge of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication in the SAM, and discuss mechanisms underlying molecular trafficking through PD and its role in plant development.},

  abstract = {The astonishingly long lives of plants and their regeneration capacity depend on the activity of plant stem cells. As in animals, stem cells reside in stem cell niches, which produce signals that regulate the balance between self-renewal and the generation of daughter cells that differentiate into new tissues. Plant stem cell niches are located within the meristems, which are organized structures that are responsible for most post-embryonic development. The continuous organ production that is characteristic of plant growth requires a robust regulatory network to keep the balance between pluripotent stem cells and differentiating progeny. Components of this network have now been elucidated and provide a unique opportunity for comparing strategies that were developed in the animal and plant kingdoms, which underlie the logic of stem cell behaviour.},

  abstract = {Plants develop postembryonically from pools of continuously active stem cells embedded in specialized tissues called meristems, which are located at the growing points of shoot and root. How these stem cells are established, maintained and guided towards differentiation within the highly dynamic shoot apical meristem is only beginning to emerge. At the core of the complex regulatory system are spatially distinct subdomains within the shoot apex, in which cells carry out defined functions, despite highly similar phenotypes. Spatial and temporal control of these domains appears to rely on an elaborate network of phytohormone signaling, transcriptional loops and intercellular trafficking of key regulators. In this review, we aim at summarizing and connecting the mechanisms underlying the spatial organization of the shoot apical meristem and the sequence of molecular events occurring during the life of a shoot cell, from its birth towards its differentiation.},
