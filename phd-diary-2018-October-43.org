* Tasks
** TODO Read Introduction to Diffusion Modelling
- http://www.mathematica-journal.com/2012/03/diffusion-modeling/
  - This could be v.good to try and translate into python as an exercise / practice
*** TODO Revise Partial Diff Equations
 - https://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~miersemann/pdebook.pdf
 - http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/TheHeatEquation.aspx
** TODO Random Walk / Diffusion tutorials
- http://courses.washington.edu/matlab1/Lesson_18.html
- http://www.math.cmu.edu/~shlomo/courses/BioSystems/Lectures/RandomWalk.pdf

** Euler's method

*** Differential equations revision

- $y^{\prime\prime} + 2y^\prime = 3y$
- $f^{\prime \prime}(x) + 2f^\prime(x) = 3f(x)$
- $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}=3y$

Solution to diff equation: function(s). Whereas algebraic equations have a number or set of numbers as their solution


*** Derivatives
- refers to instantaneous rate of change
- $\frac{dy}{dx}$
- $f^\prime(x)$ A.K.A. slope of tangent line at x

#+CAPTION: Basic properties of symplastic transport. A: model outline. All fluxes through the walls are modelled as effective permeabilities (with units μm/s). Concen- trations are given as Ci,x in cell i at location x and Wi,i+1 in the wall between cell i and i + 1. Model parameters: decay constant \sigma , cell length l, effective wall permeability q and diffusion constant D. B: time series for a 1D tissue with a single producing cell (with rate \beta/volume = 2\sigma a.u.) in the middle (q = 1μm/s, δ = 0.001s−1, l = 100μm, D = 300μm2/s). C: Dependence of profile steepness and time scales on \sigma (other parameters as in B). Simulation profiles are indicated with “S”, analytical predictions with “T”. D: Example steady state profile (solid red) with source left and reflecting wall right. This is the sum of two exponential functions (dashed): a decreasing one (cyan) and approxi- mately the continuation of its reflection on the wall (blue). E: The steepness of the con- centration profiles can be expressed using the characteristic length, the length over which the concentration drops with a factor 1/e (≈ 0.37). This can be expressed in number of cells (\lambda) or physical length (μm; \lambda′)

* Paper review for Morris group meeting
** A single fungal MAP kinase controls plant cell-to-cell invasion by the rice blast fungus cite:sakulkooSingleFungalMAP2018
- The fungus they have used is /Magnaporthe oryzae/ and it effects rice
- When this fungus gets into cells, it expands and seeks to colonise as many cells as possible. It does this by way of tendril like appendages called hyphae
- Whilst this process is happening the attacker secretes effectors that try and suppress host defence responses
- The fungus seeks out "pit fields" which are plasmodesmata rich sites and the process repeats

** What is the hypotheses
In English:
- Inhibiting a single enzyme (kinase) prevents fungal infections from spreading through plant cells



** What gap do they aim to fill

- The aim of this research is to find methods of reducing the 30% of rice crop which is lost annually to blast disease (aforementioned fungus)

** How did they design the experiments to address their questions

*** Infection in relation to PD restrictions
- The experiment started with ultrastructural analysis of cells infected by pathogens
- The analysis confirmed that fungal hyphae were present between cells
- They noticed that the infection sites' plasmodesmata were still open at 27hrs post inoculation
- Callose deposition was noticed at 30hrs as it formed around invasive hyphae
- The hypothesis proposed is that the infection was suppressing / clearing PD before penetrating into neighbouring cells

- To test whether fungus could manipulate PD's SEL (size exclusion limit) two different mCherry (flourophone) molecules were bombarded at infected tissue and again at uninfected tissue results below:

#+CAPTION: mCherry at infected cells
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm
#+NAME: fig:mcherry
[[./images/mcherry.png]]


- This showed that infection was clearly having an effect on PD being able to regulate the SEL
- And that PD were not reacting until around 25~ hrs post invasion

*** Regulatory mechanism of fungus
- Pmk1 - A MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) was identified which is essential for infection development
- PMK1 null mutants cannot infect plant leaves
- The experiment used a conditionally activated Pmk1
  - Using a chemical genetic approach
  - They generated an analog sensitive allele of PKm1 (by using magic)
- They then used this mutant, allowing PMK1 to be active at the start of the infection phase and then suppressing it
- This treatment blocked invasion of adjacent epi-dermal cells, resulting in the infected cells becoming filled with fungal hyphae
  - The morphology of the hyphae appeared unaffected
  - This was tested in both another rice cultivar and barley

*** Finding M. oryzae genes affecting infection
- RNA-seq was performed on the pmk1 mutants
- The results showed that 1457 fungal genes differentiated
  - 11.5% of the total protein-encoding genes
- 715 genes were up-regulated and 742 were down-regulated


** What were the results?
- That pmk1 could contain the key to deactivating fungus' ability to infect new cells

** What is the significance of the results

** Strengths/Weaknesses

#+CAPTION: Strengths/Weaknesses of Paper
| *Strengths*                         | *Weaknesses*                               |
|-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| Experimental design seemed en point | They still have 1400+ genes to narrow down |
|                                     | Details on RNA-seq seem pretty sparse      |


* Questions
- How do plants handle multiple attacks at once, does it struggle more at a 1:1 ratio or is it slightly easier to fend off multiple attacks as it's already producing defence chemicals/signals?
- In cite:deinumSimpleModelsComplex2013 chapter 2, figure 2.1 How does one even start to form the equations for movement
