*** TODO Design statistical tests for Jeroen's hypotheses

 1. LYM2 alters basic gene homeostasis in a PD_closure independent manner
    - Experiment: Col-0 vs. /lym2-1/ DEGs in untreated samples, reinforced if unaffected by chitin treatment/time
    - Outcome:
 2. PD-closure triggers its own transcriptional program
    - Experiment:
    - Outcome:
 3. PD-closure modulates the transcriptional reprogramming initiated by CERK1-mediated chitin signalling
    - Experiment: In Col-0 and /lym2-1/, comparing the DEGs in untreated vs, chitin treated samples
    - Outcome:
 4. PD-closure modulates the transcriptional reprogramming initiated by other MAMP/DAMP signalling after /Botrytis/ attack
    - Experiment:
    - Outcome:

** TODO Attach specific data/figures to the given hypotheses

** DONE Talk to Richard about PIPS being sorted
   CLOSED: [2019-08-22 Thu 08:24]

** TODO Come up with plan for image analysis



** TODO Look further at the difference in Col-0 vs /lym2-1/

*** Findings from previous week

- For GOs common between col & lym, lym has /mostly/ an increase in number of genes
