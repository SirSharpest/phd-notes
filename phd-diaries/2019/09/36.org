* Ideas

** Microscopy data

*** Andy's data
- Contains information about # of plasmodesmata sites

- Can give rough numbers for /total/ available flux perimeter / area

*** Annalisa's data
- Calcium wave speeds

*** Jo and Mina's data

- Information on effector mobility
- Is in /Nicotiana benthamiana/, so a little bit of a jump to AT

*** Christine's data
- Bombardment data on Col-0 and lym from citet:Faulkner2013
  - Strangely, cerk images seem to be missing?
  - Though, the literature shows that these probably aren't interesting as CERK-ko isn't receptive to chitin treatments anyway


** Questions to ask on these data

/n.b./ most bombardment assays seem to be in the scale of 24hrs post hit

*** IDEA Does cell topology have an effect on calcium waves?
- Calcium waves appear to be evenly distributed at all angles
- Defence activation in terms of flux reduction has been hinted at not being symmetrical citet:Kitagawa2018,malooksaifulOrientalArmywormMythimna2019, both in moss and maize systems
- It would be super interesting to see if there is any evidence of this in calcium propagation, if it does not hold true to this, then we may argue that ca2+ signals need another system to cause them to have impact?

*** IDEA Area / amount of PD affects the flux between cells which share this barrier
- This would have to be through proxy modelling of imposing estimations of this distribution, gleamed from AB staining assays, applied to other data we have.
- Checking for these types of consistencies in the lym mutant vs col-0 would be interesting if these are able to help give evidence to explain flux differences in response to treatments

*** IDEA Is there a relation between estimated PD layout and effector mobility
- We could use PD area data to estimate the average % of a cell's perimeter is considered to have potential for "mobility"
- Using these estimates we can see if effector molecules flow is directional i.e. in the area of least resistance
  - If not, then possibly a more strategic system is in play


*** IDEA Do different elicitors alter PD flux in the same way
- citet:Faulkner2013 uses flg22 as well as chitin for col-0, it may be interesting to explore how different receptors effect coordination
- We can simulate flg22 parameters on the chitin treated networks and vice-versa in order to test for similar outcomes.

** Action plan:

1. Label Col-0 and lym2 images
2. Test, build and implement ML extraction
3. Build networks from manually labelled data
   1. And with deep learning if results seem positive!
4. Extract PD area/perimeter
5. Build two styles of network models
   1. That contains no information on the amount of connectivity, beyond degree of connections
   2. A model which imposes flux limitations of potential PD likelihood


*** Model types
1. For the proposed plan, a simple diffusion exchange model may be suitable
2. Here an undirected graph would start with nodes initiated with 0% concentration
3. Diffusion would occur by simultatious % based exchanges with all connected nodes
   1. e.g. each connection (A<->B) would facilitate a 10% quantity exchange, a node with 2 connections would exchange lose 20% of its concentration, whilst gaining 10% from connection 1 and 10% from connection 2.
4. This would be an incredibly simple model

Other models could be used from citet:sayamaIntroductionModelingAnalysis2015
