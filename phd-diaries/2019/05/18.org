* RNA-seq data has arrived
- Functional analysis?

** TODO RNA-seq python [0/5]

- [ ] Import data
  - Data are already in TSV - Pandas
- [ ] Remove genes with no change
  - Check for genes with across all samples have < N where N is probably >3<10
- [ ] Normalise
  - For this we could just do a simple normalise to longest and create balancing factor
- [ ] Pair data with experimental / treatment info
- [ ] Produce ordered list of genes
- [ ] produce clustering dendrogram https://python-graph-gallery.com/404-dendrogram-with-heat-map/
