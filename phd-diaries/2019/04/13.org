* Tasks [3/6]

** DONE Create a data set from Christine's images for n-order connections from origin cell
   CLOSED: [2019-04-03 Wed 09:07]

- Moving to longer term goals

*** TODO Think of exact uses for this first
** TODO Show limits of instability for $\Delta x|y$
- It would be good to show that, for example, greater than 30 minutes and $\Delta x|y$ can be the length of an average cell
- This would mean the network idea could work much faster and better

** DONE Test $D_{eff}$ vector idea
   CLOSED: [2019-04-01 Mon 10:29]

*** This probably won't work

*Because if we make it a matrix, then we make the assumption that all connections to and from a cell are of a similar q, otherwise we aren't recording what's leaving and what's coming in accurately !*

Something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results raw drawer :eval never-export
  def diffuse_vectorise(un, g, b, dt, dx2, dy2, a):
      """
      Takes a state, rate of decay, production, delta time, delta space and
      flux of molecule. Uses these data to compute next time state
      """
      return (un[1:-1, 1:-1] + a *
              (((un[2:, 1:-1] - 2 * un[1:-1, 1:-1] + un[:-2, 1:-1]))/dx2 +
               ((un[1:-1, 2:] - 2 * un[1:-1, 1:-1] + un[1:-1, :-2]) / dy2))) *\
          g + b
#+END_SRC

Though, where $\alpha$ should be

\begin{equation}
\alpha =
 \begin{pmatrix}
      D_{0,0} & \cdots & D_{0,x}
      \\
      \vdots & & \vdots
      \\
      D_{y,0} & \cdots & D_{y,x}
       \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}


** TODO Look into applying for this course
[[https://coursesandconferences.wellcomegenomecampus.org/our-events/systems-biology-2019/]]

** DONE Fill out VPN form and ask Richard to sign off on it
   CLOSED: [2019-04-05 Fri 10:03]

** TODO Come up with questions to ask and answer with proposed models?
*** QUESTION Is it possible, or is there any use for coming up with probabilistic networks
- These could be inferred from Christine and J's imaging data.

**** Example table

| Origin  cell connections | avg brightness of 1st neighbours | avg brightness of 2nd neighbours |
|--------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------|
|                        4 |                              0.5 |                              0.2 |
|                        2 |                              0.7 |                              0.3 |
|                        5 |                              0.3 |                              0.1 |

* Signalling networks course

** Notes

- There are a lot of protein overlaps between pathways (Lu et al. Trends Biochem Sci 2007)
  - Some share core components, some just proteins

- E.g.
  - Input (ligands)
  - Pathway mediators (cross-talk proteins)
  - Output (transcription factors)
- Pathway definitions are not identical
- Curation rules are not uniform
- Cross-talks and overlaps (multi-pathway proteins) cannot be examined (easily)

*** Types of signalling pathways
- Canonical (e.g. mapk)
- Functional (e.g. inflammation)
- Inferred (e.g. from expression data)
  - Take out what is not expressed and it simplifies everything
- Cellular processes regulating (e.g. autophagy induction)
- Organ-related (e.g. vulva development)
- Disease-related
- Drug-related

*Highly overlapping, functionally NOT distinct pathways*
*Comparison or cross-talk analysis between different types of signalling pathways is incorrect*

*** Defining canonical signalling pathways
**** Papers
- 1998 Warkany Lecture: signaling pathways in development (john gerhart)
- The evolution of signalling pathways in animal development

** Case study citet:korcsmarosUniformlyCuratedSignaling2010
- SignaLink database
  - Korcsmaros et al., Bioifnormatics (2010), PloS ONEe (2011)
- Often interactions are inferred cross species, and report interactions which are never verified
- Key question to ask:
  - Are they physically interacting or are they indirectly interacting

** Lookup
*** Interactions lookup
- IHOP
- Chilibot
- PSICQUIC interface lookup

** Signal transduction
- Activity flows are directed interactions
- Process descriptions, directed, sequential and mechanistic
- Enzyme substrate interactions - they show directionality
*** Papers
- Concalves et al 2012 Mol. BioSyst
- Le Novere, Nat Rev Genet 2015

** Software
*** Reactome
- is for  interactions, manually curated and peer-reviewed - FOSS - pathways are hierarchically organised
- Very nice for visualisation
*** Signor
- Data structure for entities and relationships
- Grabs references for each interaction

** Cytoscape and data analysis for networks
*** Summary of intro
- Networks are useful
- Transitivity of networks is worth looking into

** Omnipath and Bypath
