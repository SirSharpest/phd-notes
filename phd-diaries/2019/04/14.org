* TODO Tasks [0/5]
** TODO Finish report!

** Explore steady state effects
- What effect does $q$ have on steady state of model and time to reach steady state?

** TODO Write up notes from meeting with Richard

*** Hypotheses

- Using trancripts, are defence responses across cells the same?
- Is there a clear cascade effect in play:
  - Perception
  - Response
- Does SA binding trigger defence
- Is there a threshold for activation of response
  - Is it low or a high threshold?
- Is defence signalled via PD
- Is SA associated with response/triggering it
- Can effectors move symplastically (imaging may show?)


** TODO Write some steady state models

*** With these SS models we can show that

**** Decay
- A high level of decay would mean that cells cannot accumulate enough of a hormone to trigger a change (assuming a threshold)
- A low level of decay leads to a linear growth

**** Production
- Production and decay are entirely relative to each other, as we assume decay is a % of total concentrations
- Changing production will keep the same trends, just different retaliative quantities
- Production > decay decreases the distance between neighbouring cell profiles

** TODO Show limits of accuracy and which points for diff model

** IDEA Can we work out transience + production of SA by using the difference in photo-activation and GFP-tagged PDLP2
