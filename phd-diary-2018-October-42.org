** TODO Understanding Plant Immunity as a surveillance system to detect invasion cite:cookUnderstandingPlantImmunity2015

*** Intro
- Crop production needs doubled by 2050 by some current estimates
- A lot of work has been done on conceptual models for plant pathogen systems
  - Details in the models vary
  - Though they all agree in the observation that plants mainly rely on innate immune systems that are largely controlled by encoded receptors that identify invasion
- It's important to note that models:
  1. Are generalisations and therefore incomplete
  2. Increasing the details of a model decreases its general applicability
  3. Multiple models can be used to explain the same phenomenon
  4. All models should be continually challenged via experimentation to advance scientific knowledge
- Models are full of limitations and narrowly define molecular plant-invader interactions
  - Additionally do not integrate experimental data from diverse systems
- Introduces the /Invasion Model/

*** Advances in explaining the plant immune system

- Talks about gene-for-gene hypothesis
- And how other research suggests "general elicitors" from microbes which could *not* be used to determine race specificity or were detected by multiple plant species
  - In contrast to pathogen Avrs that induced responses only on particular varieties of a host species
  - These seeminly different observations were regarded as disparae phenomena
  - The identification and characterisation of general elicitors and their receptors in vertebrate immunity helped to further refine the concept in plant immunity
- Charles Janeway postulated the concept of conserved microbial ligands for innate immunity to account for lapses in the conceptual model of vertebrate immunity
  - He reasoned that microbes possess pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  - That are recognised by host patter recognition receptors (PRRs) as nonself
  - He anticipated that PRRs perceive microbe-derived conserved general structural patters that are critical for the organism and require significant changes to avoid recognition
- PAMP is noted to be a misnomer, as it often concerns molecules present in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms
  - Hence why we now use the term MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular pattern)
- Talks about zigzag model (see figure in key words/phrases)

*** Limitations and incongruities in the MAMP-effector dichotomy

- Continued research into plant microbe-interactions have identified a number of concerns over the MTI-ETI dichotomy
- Issues are raised with the conceptual layout of the model in distinct phases governed by discrete responses
- A primary concern is the relationships between:
  - MAMPs and Effectors
  - PRRs and R proteins
  - MTI and ETI
- These relations also ignore DAMPs
- The zigzag model does not acknowledge the number, kinetics and combined action of multiple receptor ligands that govern these interactions
- Additionally, pathogen perception and response are illustrated over an ambiguous spatial and temporal frame, obscuring the model's intention to represent evolution or a particular cellular encounter
- The zigzag model also doesn't account for previous life history events of the hsot or invader prior to the interaction, which may influence the outcome of said interaction

** TODO Simple models for complex questions on plant development (Thesis) cite:deinumSimpleModelsComplex2013

*** Chapter 2
- To form different tissues, cells need to differentiate
- Plant cells mostly can't move
- Requirements for coordination of developmental and functional needs
- To do this cells use a number of signalling molecules
- Animals use different systems for communication of inter-cellular information
  - A Delta-notch system is one example
- Protein-Protein interactions are obviously impossible between plants, unlike in animals
- Plants can achieve results using a "non-cell-autonomous proteins" method
  - i.e. Protein signals that are transcribed in one cell and affect transcription in another
  - Like a factory which outsources some of its labour?
- These proteins move symplastically through PD channels
- Symplastic transport comes in two forms:
  1. Generic: the passive movement of all sufficiently small molecules; this is non-targeted and is diffusion driven
  2. Targeted: targeted symplastic transport is a container term for a variety of different mechanisms that allow symplastic movement of molecules that depend on it
- Virus' create their own "movement proteins" to facilitate the crossing via targeted symplastic movement
  - This process maybe involve structural alterations of the plasmodesmata, which affect the non-targeted transport properties
- Molecules moving by non-targeted symplastic transport may include plant hormones, small RNAs and small proteins
  - Providing they are small enough
  - This means that they fit the "size exclusion limit" (SEL)
  - The SEL is developmentally regulated and varies among different tissues
- The aperture of plasmodesmata is controlled through the deposition and degradation of callose
  - by callose synthase (Ca1S aka GSL gene family) and \beta-1,3-glucanase respectively
  - Further regulation takes place by other factors too cite:zavalievBiologyCalloseV12011

* Key words/phrases

** PRR
- [Host] Pattern recognition receptors
- Used to recognise PAMPs as "nonself" materials
** MTI
- MAMP-triggered immunity
- Because of the redundancy of PAMPs as an idea, this is preferred
** Effectors
- Are proteins expressed by plant pathogens
- They aid infection of specific plant species
- Are central to understanding complicated interplay between plants and their pathogens
** ETS
- Effector-Triggered Susceptibility
** ETI
- Effector-Triggered Immunity
** MTI-ETI
- A juxtaposed relationship between MTI-ETI is often misunderstood
- For example, some would believe that the processes are independent and therefore not at a similar level
** DAMPs
- Damage associated molecular patterns
** Kinase
- Is an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate donating molecules to specific substrates
** Dichotomy
- A divison or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different
- e.g. 'a rigid dichotomy between science and the DUP'
** Advection
- The transfer of heat or matter by the flow of a fluid

* Questions
- Regarding DAMPs and general damage control there must be some overlap or at least connection in the pathways that ultimately lead to repair or maintenance
- Are plants/cells aware of other cells around them. i.e. if there was a "perfect" invasion and a pathogen prevented the cell sending any signals and it just "stopped" communicating, would the border cells know something was up and try to correct?
  - Similarly, if you perfectly removed a group of cells, a plant repairs itself what's this communication method?
- Bacteria have been attacking plants for millions of years, why haven't they won, yet we fight them with anti-biotics for a century and they're looking like they'll overcome pretty quickly
- Two identical plants, control conditions, infected with same pathogen, is it likely for them to develop a similar response or is there a level of ambiguity in the choices made to protection, prevention and developing immunity?
- If a crab eats a plant, does the plant think its a fungal attack?
- Do many attackers perform prolonged, dormancy based attacks or is it an all out attack most of the time?
- During an attack, is it possible to something like bacteria to adapt during the attack and to adapt, or is that too small a timescale?
  - If so is this a potential concern for any kind of analysis, that is to say should we expect "experimental tactics" from the invaders?
- Things that the plant makes, are they somehow signed by the cell to prove authenticity or how do receptors / w/e know that it isn't foreign
- Is the MAMPs response like a magnet i.e. how mechanical is the process, like molecules naturally drawn together v.s. a more fluid process of decision making and evaluation of the attack
- Mutants with bad callose deposition reportedly don't make it much further than embryo stage, what other functions than PD does it affect?
